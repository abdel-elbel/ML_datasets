Catalytic ozonation has been widely concerned due to its high efficiency and environmental compatibility compared with traditional approaches. While previous reviews have been summarized the catalytic ozonation technology based on the types of VOCs, there is a lack of systematic synthesis of advancements in catalyst design, especially the tailoring strategy of nanostructures, aiming at the scientific problems of active center competition, slow electron transfer rate, low ozone utilization and low mass transfer efficiency. This work systematically investigates the research progress on various metal-based catalysts (noble metals and transition metal oxides) and catalyst configurations (mixed-metals and single-atom catalysts) at the nanoscale. The purpose of this review is to propose precise enhancement strategies tailored to different scenarios, leveraging synergistic optimization of nanoscale configuration and electronic microenvironment based on catalytic ozonation mechanisms involving oxidation pathways and active sites. In addition, the problem of catalyst deactivation of various types of VOCs are examined. This review comprehensively summarizes the current research progress, proposes practical enhancement strategies to address technical bottlenecks, which provides new insights and directions for the future development of catalytic ozonation technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Electronic Microenvironment; Metal-based Catalyst; Nanoscale Configuration; Vocs","","","","The authors thank the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2024YFC3712500 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52070195 , 21876212 , 524B2141 ), and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Nos. 2025A1515011307 , 2023A1515012198 ) for financially supporting this work.","Wu, Muyan, A review of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) degradation by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) catalytic oxidation, Journal of Environmental Management, 307, (2022); Wang, Liangliang, Treatment of VOCs with a wet scrubbing – catalytic ozonation process: Efficiency, mechanism and pilot-scale application, Separation and Purification Technology, 336, (2024); Zhao, Zhenyuan, A systematic review of intermediates and their characterization methods in VOCs degradation by different catalytic technologies, Separation and Purification Technology, 314, (2023); Huang, Lyuyin, Global Anthropogenic Emissions of Full-Volatility Organic Compounds, Environmental Science and Technology, 57, 43, pp. 16435-16445, (2023); China Statistical Yearbook on Environment, (2023); Kamal, Muhammad Shahzad, Catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - A review, Atmospheric Environment, 140, pp. 117-134, (2016); Kim, Minsu, Oxidation of gaseous formaldehyde with ozone over MnOx/TiO2 catalysts at room temperature (25 °C), Powder Technology, 325, pp. 368-372, (2018); Khan, Faisal I., Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds from polluted air, Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 13, 6, pp. 527-545, (2000); Wang, Jing, Mesoporous catalysts for catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds: Preparations, mechanisms and applications, Reviews in Chemical Engineering, 39, 4, pp. 541-565, (2023); Barbusiński, Krzysztof, Biological methods for odor treatment – A review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 152, pp. 223-241, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00108545","","CCHRA","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013209982"

Toluene, a prevalent VOC, is commonly employed as a model compound in laboratory studies due to its widespread occurrence across various industrial sectors. Catalytic oxidation has emerged as a highly effective method for removing toluene from exhaust gases. Among various catalytic materials, cobalt oxides (CoO<inf>x</inf>) have garnered increasing attention for their potential as active species and additives in toluene degradation, owing to their ease of synthesis and cost-effectiveness. This review summarizes recent developments in the catalytic oxidation of toluene using CoO<inf>x</inf>-based catalysts.

This study investigates the water-promoted plasma-catalytic oxidation of C5 using noble metal-loaded 1.5Mn-CeO<inf>2</inf> catalysts. This approach combines non-thermal plasma with advanced catalyst design to achieve efficient oxidation at near-room temperature (30 °C). Among the tested noble metals (Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd), 0.4 wt% Pd/1.5Mn-CeO<inf>2</inf> exhibited exceptional performance, with C5 conversion increasing by 15 % and CO<inf>x</inf> selectivity improving significantly with the addition of 1 % H<inf>2</inf>O. In contrast, 0.7 wt% Au/1.5Mn-CeO<inf>2</inf> showed superior activity under dry conditions but suffered performance loss with H<inf>2</inf>O addition. Operando DRIFTS and kinetic analyses revealed that water vapor enhanced Pd-catalyzed oxidation by generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH), promoting the complete oxidation of C5, while inhibiting Au-based catalyst via bidentate carbonate formation. The synergistic plasma-catalytic effect enabled near-complete C5 oxidation at 30 °C with high CO<inf>x</inf> selectivity (>90 %), significantly lowering the energy barrier compared to thermal catalysis alone. Structural characterization (XRD, XPS, and EPR) confirmed that Mn doping and Pd loading optimized oxygen vacancy concentration and redox properties, with Pd/1.5Mn-CeO<inf>2</inf> demonstrating robust water tolerance due to its high proportion of chemically adsorbed water.

This study achieved and elucidated simultaneous bioremoval of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and elemental mercury (Hg0) in simulated low-O<inf>2</inf> content flue gas by a sulfur-oxidizing membrane biofilm reactor. Optimal removal efficiencies of DMS and Hg0 attained 92 % and 94 %, respectively, at 2 % O<inf>2</inf> content in a 140-day operation. A variety of facultative anaerobes: Thiobacillus, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Alcaligenes, and Hyphomicrobium synergized DMS reductive degradation, partial sulfur oxidation, and Hg0 bio-oxidation. Overall, DMS and Hg0 acted as the initial donors and their oxidation products further co-stabilized, O<inf>2</inf> acted as the terminal acceptor, and thereby to collaboratively establish a bio-redox. Specifically, at 2–4 % O<inf>2</inf>, DMS can be oxygenated to H<inf>2</inf>S and then partially oxidized to S0; sulfur reducing bacteria can also anaerobically oxidize DMS to H<inf>2</inf>S and prevent its further oxidation. At 11 % O<inf>2</inf>, DMS was excessively oxidized to SO<inf>4</inf>2−. Hg0 was effectively bio-oxidized to Hg2+ at 2, 4, and 11 % O<inf>2</inf>. However, Hg0 was primarily bio-stabilized into HgS with biogenic S2− and S0 at 2–4 % O<inf>2</inf> via Hg2+-S2− precipitation, Hg0-S0 chemosorption, and catalase-mediated in situ Hg0-S0 bio-redox. HCHO derived from DMS oxygenation can be metabolized into CO<inf>2</inf> via O<inf>2</inf> respiration. Microaerobic synergistic bioconversion of DMS and Hg0 into S0 and HgS can provide a greener and integrated strategy for flue gas desulfurization and demercuration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combustion Flue Gas; Dms Biodegradation; Hg0 Biostabilization; O2 Content; Synergistic Bioremoval; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Combustion; Decontamination; Flues; Mercury (metal); Mercury Compounds; Oxidation; Oxygenation; Sulfur; Sulfur Compounds; Biostabilization; Combustion Flue Gas; Dimethyl Sulphide Biodegradation; Dimethylsulphide; Elemental Mercury; Hg0 Biostabilization; Membrane Biofilm Reactor; Micro Aerobics; O2 Content; Synergistic Bioremoval; Biodegradation; Flue Gases","Bacteria; Bacteriology; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Combustion; Decontamination; Flues; Mercury (metal); Mercury compounds; Oxidation; Oxygenation; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Biostabilization; Combustion flue gas; Dimethyl sulphide biodegradation; Dimethylsulphide; Elemental mercury; Hg0 biostabilization; Membrane biofilm reactor; Micro aerobics; O2 content; Synergistic bioremoval; Biodegradation; Flue gases","","","The authors acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 42307293 ) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2023M741233 ).","Chen, Limei, Economic analysis on sewage sludge drying and its co-combustion in municipal solid waste power plant, Waste Management, 121, pp. 11-22, (2021); Presto, Albert A., Survey of catalysts for oxidation of mercury in flue gas, Environmental Science and Technology, 40, 18, pp. 5601-5609, (2006); Liu, Yangxian, Photochemical oxidation removal of Hg0 from flue gas containing SO2/NO by an ultraviolet irradiation/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H 2O2) process, Energy and Fuels, 28, 3, pp. 2135-2143, (2014); Sun, Yunan, Behaviour of mercury during Co-incineration of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste, Journal of Cleaner Production, 253, (2020); Takaoka, Masaki, Mercury emission from sewage sludge incineration in Japan, Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management, 14, 2, pp. 113-119, (2012); Li, Guoliang, The influence of flue gas components and activated carbon injection on mercury capture of municipal solid waste incineration in China, Chemical Engineering Journal, 326, pp. 561-569, (2017); Zhang, Yuna, Malodorous gases production from food wastes decomposition by indigenous microorganisms, Science of the Total Environment, 717, (2020); Ducom, Gaëlle, Biogas - Municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash interactions: Sulphur compounds removal, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 166, 2-3, pp. 1102-1108, (2009); Haider, Kawssar Mujtaba, Chemical identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds emitted by sewage sludge, Science of the Total Environment, 838, (2022); Ding, Wenjie, Investigation of the effects of temperature and sludge characteristics on odors and VOC emissions during the drying process of sewage sludge, Water Science and Technology, 72, 4, pp. 543-552, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014921223"

However, photocatalysts often lose activity under real conditions. Unlike laboratory settings, real air contains many organic compounds. These can cause competitive adsorption, form reactive byproducts, and poison the surface. As a result, photocatalytic performance drops over time. This review explains the main reasons for deactivation in gas-phase systems. These include the buildup of carbon residues, formation of byproducts with nitrogen or sulfur, coke deposits, and damage to the material's structure. We also discuss how surface defects, crystal structure, and particle shape affect both activity and durability. Different methods to restore activity are reviewed. These include heating, chemical cleaning, and light-based recovery. We also highlight recent advances in material design. Examples include single-site catalysts and porous structures such as metal organic frameworks. These materials can improve selectivity and resist deactivation. Machine learning is also gaining attention. It can help predict stability and guide the design of better photocatalysts. Although deactivation is widely studied, few reports focus on gas-phase systems with a clear mechanistic view. This review fills that gap. It combines experiments with analysis to support the design of stable and reusable photocatalysts for clean air. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Stability; Photocatalyst Deactivation; Photocatalytic Oxidation; Regeneration Techniques; Surface Fouling; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Cleaners; Catalyst Deactivation; Catalyst Regeneration; Chemical Cleaning; Gases; Metal-organic Frameworks; Petroleum Deposits; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic Activity; Photooxidation; Surface Defects; Catalyst Stability; Gas-phase Systems; Photocatalyst Deactivation; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Photooxidation Mechanism; Regeneration Strategies; Regeneration Technique; Stability Enhancement; Surface Fouling; Volatile Organics; Volatile Organic Compounds","Air cleaners; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst regeneration; Chemical cleaning; Gases; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Petroleum deposits; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; Photooxidation; Surface defects; Catalyst stability; Gas-phase systems; Photocatalyst deactivation; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photooxidation mechanism; Regeneration strategies; Regeneration technique; Stability enhancement; Surface fouling; Volatile organics; Volatile organic compounds","","","","Padmanabhan, Nisha T., Graphene coupled TiO2 photocatalysts for environmental applications: A review, Chemosphere, 271, (2021); Lu, Mingxia, Directional deep oxidation of toluene via phenolized pathway—A review concerning dominant factors involved in photocatalysis, Frontiers of Environmental Science and Engineering, 19, 2, (2025); Huang, Lihui, Estimates of emission strengths of 43 VOCs in wintertime residential indoor environments, Beijing, Science of the Total Environment, 793, (2021); Qu, Xiao, Efficient VOCs photodegradation through local ion substitution in TiO2–C composites derived from MIL-125(Ti), Chemosphere, 369, (2024); Mamari, Said Al, 3-Dimensional cube In2O3/g-C3N4 nanosheet composite for photodegradation of VOC-contaminated water, Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy, 334, (2025); Gil, Roberto Rodríguez, VOCs removal by adsorption onto activated carbons from biocollagenic wastes of vegetable tanning, Chemical Engineering Journal, 245, pp. 80-88, (2014); Li, Shijie, The application of dielectric barrier discharge non-thermal plasma in VOCs abatement: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 388, (2020); Huang, Jianghua, Strategic defect engineering in TiO2 catalysts through electron beam irradiation: Unraveling enhanced photocatalytic pathways for multicomponent VOCs degradation, Separation and Purification Technology, 359, (2025); Sahrin, Nurul Tasnim, Current perspectives of anodized TiO2 nanotubes towards photodegradation of formaldehyde: A short review, Environmental Technology and Innovation, 22, (2021); Fang, Yingmei, Boosting VOCs photodegradation performance of Co-doped WO3 nanofibers through efficient oxygen activation and localized electric field construction, Applied Surface Science, 637, (2023)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22133437","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009233383"

The capture and degradation of pollutants in wastewater using nanomaterials (NMs) has emerged as a cost-effective and highly efficient strategy through adsorption, membrane filtration, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including heterogeneous photocatalysis. This review examines NMs features that influence their optoelectronic properties and resulting performance in the AOPs that can be employed in wastewater treatment. This work particularly highlights the modification of NMs by low-temperature and atmospheric pressure plasmas e.g., dielectric barrier discharge, plasma jet, corona and gliding arc discharge. These plasma modification strategies are favored over conventional chemical methods due to their minimal waste generation, production of non-toxic byproducts, preservation of bulk material properties, solvent-free (dry) operation, rapid, energy-efficient processing, and scalability to large areas. Emphasis is placed on defect engineering, the generation of oxygen vacancies, and surface functionalization of NMs by plasma. These key factors can shift the band gap of NMs, improve charge carrier separation, boost reactive oxygen species formation, provide additional pathways for charge transfer, enhance visible light response, and increase surface area. Collectively, these effects alter the performance of NMs in pollutant degradation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cold Plasma; Nanomaterials (nms); Photocatalysis; Plasma Modifications; Wastewater Treatment","","","","This work was supported by the project LM2023039 funded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.

Various technologies such as activated carbon filtration, solution adsorption, and catalytic decomposition have been employed to mitigate ozone pollution. Among these, room-temperature catalytic ozone decomposition has gained attention due to its high efficiency, low energy requirements, and the absence of harmful by-products. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in ozone decomposition catalysts, categorizing and evaluating their properties and mechanisms of action. The discussion also includes the catalytic degradation and deactivation mechanisms, with proposed synergistic processes for the simultaneous removal of ozone and volatile organic compounds, and the mechanism for catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment. Additionally, primary pathways for catalyst deactivation are identified along with protocols for catalyst reactivation. Finally, this review addresses the challenges of catalytic ozone decomposition and offers recommendations for future catalyst designs to improve performance and durability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Design; Catalytic Ozone Removal; Ozone Decomposition; Reaction Mechanism; Air Pollution; Catalyst Deactivation; Health Risks; Ozone; Ozone Water Treatment; Volatile Organic Compounds; Atmospheric Pollutants; Catalyst Designs; Catalytic Ozone; Catalytic Ozone Removal; Decomposition Mechanism; Future Challenges; Ozone Decomposition; Ozone Removal; Reaction Mechanism; ]+ Catalyst; Ozonization; Wastewater Treatment","Air pollution; Catalyst deactivation; Health risks; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric pollutants; Catalyst designs; Catalytic ozone; Catalytic ozone removal; Decomposition mechanism; Future challenges; Ozone decomposition; Ozone removal; Reaction mechanism; ]+ catalyst; Ozonization; Wastewater treatment","","","C.H. and Y.T. contributed equally to this work.

However, practical application is constrained by secondary ozone (O₃) emissions and incomplete degradation of CVOCs to CO<inf>2</inf> and HCl. To address these limitations, a liquid-phase UV system was integrated downstream of the NTP reactor to convert O₃ into reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing DCM mineralization. The results showed that the degradation efficiency (DE) and mineralization rate (MR) of DCM in the NTP+UV(L) system reached 83.5 % and 73.9 %, respectively, which were markedly elevated compared to those of the NTP system (DE: 17.3 %, MR: 20.9 %) and the UV(L) system (DE: 28.7 %, MR: 36.1 %). The synergistic effect in this combined system was attributed to the activation of O<inf>3</inf> into hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and superoxide ions (·O<inf>2</inf>-) by UV light in the solution for the deep oxidation of DCM. The chlorine in DCM was converted into chloride ions (Cl-) and trapped in the solution. Finally, the reaction pathways of DCM within the NTP+UV(L) system were inferred by detecting organic intermediates in both the gas and liquid phases. This novel combined NTP+UV(L) system represents a potential method for DCM degradation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dichloromethane; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Reutilization; Synergistic Effect; Wet Scrubber; Chloride Minerals; Efficiency; Ozone; Photodegradation; Reaction Intermediates; Scrubbers; Ultraviolet Devices; Volatile Organic Compounds; Degradation Efficiency; L-systems; Liquid Phasis; Mineralisation; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Reutilization; Re-utilization; Synergistic Effect; Volatile Organics; Wet Scrubbers; Mineralogy","Chloride minerals; Efficiency; Ozone; Photodegradation; Reaction intermediates; Scrubbers; Ultraviolet devices; Volatile organic compounds; Degradation efficiency; L-systems; Liquid phasis; Mineralisation; Nonthermal plasma; Ozone reutilization; Re-utilization; Synergistic effect; Volatile organics; Wet scrubbers; Mineralogy","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Fund Project ( 52300137 ), Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shanxi Province of China (No. 2021JQ- 508 ), Research on the Layout of Gas-related Pollution Sources Based on Multi-source Data ( 2021SF-501 ), and Research on the Evaluation Index System of Atmospheric Environmental Impact of Typical Industries in Shaanxi Province ( 2021SF-498 ).","Abd-Allah, Zaenab, Remediation of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) using non-thermal, atmospheric pressure plasma generated in a packed-bed reactor, Environmental Science and Technology, 48, 1, pp. 558-565, (2014); Almomani, Fares, Mineralization of dichloromethane using solar-oxidation and activated TiO2: Pilot scale study, Solar Energy, 172, pp. 116-127, (2018); Asgari, Ghorban, Optimization of synthesis a new composite of nano-MgO, CNT and Graphite as a catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for the treatment of pesticide-laden wastewater, Journal of Water Process Engineering, 33, (2020); Asgari, Ghorban, Concurrent elimination of arsenic and nitrate from aqueous environments through a novel nanocomposite: Fe3O4-ZIF8@eggshell membrane matrix, Journal of Molecular Liquids, 411, (2024); Barki, Debra, Removal of Chlorinated Organic Pollutants from Groundwater Using a Vacuum-UV-Based Advanced Oxidation Process, ACS ES and T Water, 1, 9, pp. 2076-2086, (2021); Borkar, Chetan, Adsorption of dichloromethane on activated carbon, Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data, 55, 4, pp. 1640-1644, (2010); Chang, Zhengshi, Progress in degradation of volatile organic compounds based on low-temperature plasma technology, Plasma Processes and Polymers, 17, 4, (2020); Cheng, Chiehan, Exposure and health risk assessment of indoor volatile organic compounds in a medical university, Environmental Research, 213, (2022); Dehane, Aissa, Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) sonochemistry: A comprehensive mechanistic and kinetics analysis elucidating how CCl4 pyrolysis improves the sonolytic degradation of nonvolatile organic contaminants, Separation and Purification Technology, 275, (2021); Deng, Wei, Effect of preparation method on the performance of porous RuOx/Co3O4 catalysts for 1, 2-dichloroethane oxidation, Applied Catalysis A: General, 624, (2021)","","Institution of Chemical Engineers","","","","","","09575820; 17443598","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010844626"

However, incomplete pyrolysis during biochar production may result in the retention of hazardous organic compounds, which can be emitted into the atmosphere during field application. In this study, biochar was produced at both lab- and pilot-scales under varying conditions, including manure type (cow and chicken), pyrolysis temperature (400°C and 700°C), and residence time (5–12 min). Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) were evaluated across a temperature range of 35–280°C. Lab-scale results revealed that pyrolysis temperature had a more significant influence on VOC emissions than residence time. For example, total VOC concentrations measured at 50°C were 73.4 μg g–1 for biochar produced at 400°C, compared to 4.96 μg g–1 at 700°C. In a modeled field scenario, where 1 metric ton of pilot-scale biochar is mixed into soil (density 1.5 g cm–3; application rate 5 wt%), predicted ambient total VOC concentrations at 2 m height ranged from 8740 to 52,513 μg m–3. These levels far exceed the WHO's indoor air quality target of 250 μg m–3, indicating substantial risk. Therefore, pyrolysis at or above 700°C and strict thermal management are essential for safe biochar production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biochar; Fertilizer; Livestock Manure; Thermal Desorption; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Quality; Biohazards; Carbon Sequestration; Fertilizers; Indoor Air Pollution; Manures; Organic Carbon; Pyrolysis; Waste Management; Biochar; Carbon Neutralities; Livestock Manure; Pilot Scale; Pyrolysis Temperature; Residence Time; Thermal; Total Volatile Organic Compounds; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; Volatile Organics; Volatile Organic Compounds","Air quality; Biohazards; Carbon sequestration; Fertilizers; Indoor air pollution; Manures; Organic carbon; Pyrolysis; Waste management; Biochar; Carbon neutralities; Livestock manure; Pilot scale; Pyrolysis temperature; Residence time; Thermal; Total volatile organic compounds; Volatile organic compound emission; Volatile organics; Volatile organic compounds","","","This study was supported by the development of ammonia emission factors according to the method of converting livestock manure into resources by livestock type (Korean beef, dairy cow, pig, and chicken) (RS-2022-RD010222) collaborative research program between the University and Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea and a grant (YL-WE-23\u2013001) from the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Waste to Energy-Recycling Human Resource Development Project.","Agegnehu, Getachew, Biochar and biochar-compost as soil amendments: Effects on peanut yield, soil properties and greenhouse gas emissions in tropical North Queensland, Australia, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 213, pp. 72-85, (2015); Agegnehu, Getachew, The role of biochar and biochar-compost in improving soil quality and crop performance: A review, Applied Soil Ecology, 119, pp. 156-170, (2017); An, Young-ji, Assessment of toxicological validity using tobacco emission condensates: A comparative analysis of emissions and condensates from 3R4F reference cigarettes and heated tobacco products, Environment International, 185, (2024); Anake, Winifred U., Indoor air quality in day-care centres: a global review, Air Quality, Atmosphere and Health, 16, 5, pp. 997-1022, (2023); Azargohar, Ramin, Evaluation of properties of fast pyrolysis products obtained, from Canadian waste biomass, Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 104, pp. 330-340, (2013); Brown, Veronica M., Evaluation of the stability of a mixture of volatile organic compounds on sorbents for the determination of emissions from indoor materials and products using thermal desorption/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, Journal of Chromatography A, 1350, pp. 1-9, (2014); Bruun, Esben Wilson, Biochar amendment to coarse sandy subsoil improves root growth and increases water retention, Soil Use and Management, 30, 1, pp. 109-118, (2014); Buss, Wolfram, High-VOC biochar—effectiveness of post-treatment measures and potential health risks related to handling and storage, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 23, 19, pp. 19580-19589, (2016); Buss, Wolfram, Inherent organic compounds in biochar-Their content, composition and potential toxic effects, Journal of Environmental Management, 156, pp. 150-157, (2015); Cantrell, Keri Baker, Role of thermochemical conversion in livestock waste-to-energy treatments: Obstacles and opportunities, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 46, 26, pp. 8918-8927, (2007)","","Institution of Chemical Engineers","","","","","","09575820; 17443598","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010838414"

Composites prepared with bulk Si/Al molar ratios (1 and 2), ZnO/Al loadings (0.10, 0.15, and 0.20), were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), N<inf>2</inf>-sorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV–vis spectroscopy. A custom-built flow cell was used for gas-phase α-pinene degradation, while aqueous methylene blue degradation was evaluated under batch conditions. A key finding of the study was that increasing ZnO content led to matrix densification, reduced surface area, and blue shifting of the adsorption band. Structural studies revealed that ZnO was integrated into the geopolymer framework through bonding with aluminium within the composite. The highest 160 mg/L methylene blue removal (91.05 %) was achieved by a geopolymer with Si/Al ratio of 2 and attributed to naturally occurring TiO<inf>2</inf> phases in the metakaolin coupled with a high surface area. These samples exhibited superior continuous α-pinene degradation, with a maximum removal of 26.93 %, which was attributed to reduced Al–OH surface groups and lower hydrophilicity, favouring VOC adsorption. Significantly, this research identifies the critical parameters of incorporating ZnO into a geopolymer framework, suggesting that both the concentration of ZnO added, and the microstructural modification induced by ZnO play important roles in determining photocatalytic activity. This study revealed how ZnO influences the physicochemical characteristics of geopolymers, and the remediation mechanism of pollutants from aqueous and gaseous environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkali-activated Materials; Metakaolin; Methylene Blue Removal; Photocatalysis; Sustainable Photocatalysts; Voc Abatement; Zno-geopolymer Composites; Α-pinene Degradation; Bioremediation; Chemical Shift; Gas Absorption; Gas Adsorption; Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Photocatalytic Activity; Physisorption; Smoke Abatement; Water Absorption; Activated Materials; Alkali-activated; Alkali-activated Material; Geopolymer Composites; Metakaolins; Methylene Blue; Methylene Blue Removal; Sustainable Photocatalyst; Voc Abatement; Vocs Abatement; Zno; Zno-geopolymer Composite; Α-pinene Degradation; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy","Bioremediation; Chemical shift; Gas absorption; Gas adsorption; Near infrared spectroscopy; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Photocatalytic activity; Physisorption; Smoke abatement; Water absorption; Activated materials; Alkali-activated; Alkali-activated material; Geopolymer composites; Metakaolins; Methylene Blue; Methylene blue removal; Sustainable photocatalyst; VOC abatement; VOCs abatement; ZnO; ZnO-geopolymer composite; Α-pinene degradation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","","","This study is sponsored by the University of Bath Research Scholarship Award (J Wilson).

And MOF-derived metal oxides prepared by the sacrificial template method have been widely applied as catalysts for pollutant removal. Accordingly, we prepared a series of MOF-derived MnO<inf>x</inf> catalysts with diverse morphologies (rod-like, flower-like, slab-like) via the pyrolysis of MOF precursors, and the as-prepared MnO<inf>x</inf> catalysts demonstrated superior performance compared to the one prepared using the co-precipitation method. MnO<inf>x</inf>-II, with a flower-like structure, exhibited excellent activity for formaldehyde (HCHO) catalytic ozonation at room temperature, reaching complete HCHO conversion at O<inf>3</inf>/HCHO of 1.5 and more than 90% CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity at an O<inf>3</inf>/HCHO ratio of 2.5. On the basis of various characterization methods, it was clarified that the enhanced catalytic performance of MnO<inf>x</inf>-II benefited from its larger BET surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, better redox ability at lower temperature, and more Lewis acid sites. The H<inf>2</inf>O resistance and stability tests were also conducted. Furthermore, DFT calculations substantiated the enhanced adsorption of HCHO and O<inf>3</inf> on oxygen vacancies, while in–situ DRIFTS measurements elucidated the degradation pathway of HCHO during catalytic ozonation through detected intermediates. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Dft Calculations; Formaldehyde; Manganese Oxides; Metal-organic-frameworks; Catalyst Activity; Catalyst Selectivity; Cobalt Compounds; Crystalline Materials; Design For Testability; Gas Adsorption; Manganese Oxide; Metal-organic Frameworks; Oxides; Ozonization; Precipitation (chemical); Catalytic Ozonation; Dft Calculation; Hot Topics; Metal-oxide; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Performance; Pollutants Removal; Research Fields; Sacrificial Template Methods; ]+ Catalyst; Oxygen Vacancies","Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Cobalt compounds; Crystalline materials; Design for testability; Gas adsorption; Manganese oxide; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Oxides; Ozonization; Precipitation (chemical); Catalytic ozonation; DFT calculation; Hot topics; Metal-oxide; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Performance; Pollutants removal; Research fields; Sacrificial template methods; ]+ catalyst; Oxygen vacancies","","","This research was supported by the \u201CPioneer\u201D and \u201CLeading Goose\u201D R&D Program of Zhejiang (2023C03126), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52125605), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2022ZFJH04).","Héquet, Valérie, Photocatalytic oxidation of VOCs at ppb level using a closed-loop reactor: The mixture effect, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 226, pp. 473-486, (2018); Ji, Jian, Potassium-modulated δ-MnO2 as robust catalysts for formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 260, (2020); He, Chun, Facet Engineered α-MnO2for Efficient Catalytic Ozonation of Odor CH3SH: Oxygen Vacancy-Induced Active Centers and Catalytic Mechanism, Environmental Science and Technology, 54, 19, pp. 12771-12783, (2020); Zhang, Changbin, Perfect catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde over a Pt/TiO2 catalyst at room temperature, Catalysis Communications, 6, 3, pp. 211-214, (2005); Qu, Jiafu, 3D Gold-Modified Cerium and Cobalt Oxide Catalyst on a Graphene Aerogel for Highly Efficient Catalytic Formaldehyde Oxidation, Small, 15, 2, (2019); Chen, Yongwei, A new MOF-505@GO composite with high selectivity for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation, Chemical Engineering Journal, 308, pp. 1065-1072, (2017); Chen, Muhua, Facet- and defect-engineered Pt/Fe2O3 nanocomposite catalyst for catalytic oxidation of airborne formaldehyde under ambient conditions, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 395, (2020); Guan, Shengnan, A review of the preparation and applications of MnO2 composites in formaldehyde oxidation, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 66, pp. 126-140, (2018); Zhu, Dandan, Formaldehyde Oxidation over Co@N-Doped Carbon at Room Temperature: Tunable Co Size and Intensified Surface Electron Density, ACS ES and T Engineering, 1, 5, pp. 917-927, (2021); Guo, Yunlong, Recent advances in VOC elimination by catalytic oxidation technology onto various nanoparticles catalysts: a critical review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 281, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20734344","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014498896"

Catalytic oxidation is extensively recognized as an emerging technology for VOC elimination, as it produces no secondary pollutants and requires low energy input. This review systematically examines recent advancements in supported noble metal catalysts (SNM), supported transition metal catalysts (STM) and non-supported transition metal oxides (NSTM) for VOC oxidation. First, various types of VOCs and their emission sources are discussed. Next, recent progress in the catalytic oxidation of different VOCs using SNM, STM and NSTM is reviewed. The oxidation mechanisms of VOCs are then comprehensively summarized. Additionally, the effects of reaction conditions, including the presence of H<inf>2</inf>O, CO<inf>2</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, Cl species as well as reactant composition, concentration, and space velocity, on catalyst performance, deactivation, and regeneration approaches are explored.

This review analyzes the current technological challenges and investigates recent developments in biological treatment technologies for VOC-contaminated off-gases, including biofilters, biotrickling filters, and bioscrubber, as well as emerging technologies, such as bioaugmentation and microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Operational performance, economic feasibility, and adaptability to various industrial applications are assessed, alongside opportunities for integration with other technologies, including energy recovery technologies. Biological systems offer considerable advantages regarding cost savings and lower environmental impacts and enhanced operational flexibility, particularly when combined with innovative materials and microbial optimization techniques. Nevertheless, challenges persist, such as choosing the best treatment settings suited to different VOC streams and addressing biofilm control concerns and scalability. Overall, biological VOC treatments are encouraging sustainable solutions, though continued research into reactor design, microbial dynamics, and MFC-based energetic valorization is essential for broader industrial application.

Thus, the lab-scale casuarina seed-packed biofilter was performed with industrial settings i.e. different inlet concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) in a mixture for their synchronized removal. Comparative computational models were studied using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the individual pollutant performance in terms of removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC). The synergistic effects of the individual pollutants load on the RE and EC were studied effectively. The response surface plots indicated that the developed biofilter could potentially eliminate multicomponent in the order of benzene>xylene>toluene with the decreasing order of toluene>xylene>benzene inlet concentrations. The RSM model prediction was cross verified by investigating the causal index (CI) analysis, applied to govern the effect of one variable on another beyond mere connection. The CI analysis confirmed that the toluene and xylene had a negative effect on their own RE and had positive effects on other pollutant performance; however, toluene vigorously supported the benzene and xylene biodegradation. The computational models show significant fluctuation in predicting responses due to substrate competitive inhibition, accumulation of toxic intermediates, and increasing multipollutant loads. Finally, the mathematical model was employed to predict the theoretical EC and average biofilm thickness at different regimes of biofiltration. The identified significant interaction information is more beneficial in designing and operating the multicomponent biofilter rationally. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofiltration; Mathematical Model; Multicomponent; Neural Networks; Synergistic Effects; Approximation Theory; Computational Efficiency; Dynamic Models; Forecasting; Numerical Models; Optimization; Biofiltrations; Computational Modelling; Elimination Capacity; Inlet Concentration; Multicomponents; Neural-networks; Performance; Removal Efficiencies; Response-surface Methodology; Synergistic Effect; Analytical Models","Approximation theory; Computational efficiency; Dynamic models; Forecasting; Numerical models; Optimization; Biofiltrations; Computational modelling; Elimination capacity; Inlet concentration; Multicomponents; Neural-networks; Performance; Removal efficiencies; Response-surface methodology; Synergistic effect; Analytical models","","","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) ( RS-2021-NR059190 ).","Mangotra, Anju, Volatile organic compounds: A threat to the environment and health hazards to living organisms – A review, Journal of Biotechnology, 382, pp. 51-69, (2024); Oliveira, Kevin, On the uncertainty of anthropogenic aromatic volatile organic compound emissions: Model evaluation and sensitivity analysis, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 24, 12, pp. 7137-7177, (2024); Ling, Chaohao, Global impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on surface concentration and health risk of atmospheric benzene, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 23, 5, pp. 3311-3324, (2023); Halios, Christos H., Chemicals in European residences – Part I: A review of emissions, concentrations and health effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Science of the Total Environment, 839, (2022); Divya, Baskaran, A comprehensive review and perspective research in technology integration for the treatment of gaseous volatile organic compounds, Environmental Research, 251, (2024); Saeedi, Meysam, Interaction of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene with human's body: Insights into characteristics, sources and health risks, Journal of Hazardous Materials Advances, 16, (2024); undefined; González-Martín, Javier, Indoor air VOCs biofiltration by bioactive coating packed bed bioreactors, Journal of Environmental Management, 349, (2024); Severi, Cristian Alfredo, Pilot-scale biogas desulfurization through anoxic biofiltration, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 485, (2025); Han, Meng Fei, Comparison of separated and combined photodegradation and biofiltration technology for the treatment of volatile organic compounds: A critical review, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 52, 8, pp. 1325-1355, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22133437","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005028676"

The characteristics of the catalysts were characterized and analyzed by various physical and chemical characterization methods, confirming the successful synthesis of spinel materials. The specific surface area of four bimetallic spinel catalysts prepared via sol-gel method (130-150 m2/g) is significantly higher than that of conventional spinels (45-49 m2/g). CoMn2O4 displayed superior plasma-assisted catalytic performance compared to other three catalysts. When the specific energy density was 766.35JL-1, the degradation efficiency of toluene was 93.0%, the energy efficiency was 4.56 g·kWh-1, the total COx selectivity was 93.6% and the conversion efficiency of NO reached 100%. Lattice oxygen in the catalyst plays a crucial role in the oxidation of toluene and NO. Oxygen vacancies and electron migration between Mn4+/ Mn3+ in the spinel phase enhance the production and migration of reactive oxygen species, as well as the replenishment of lattice oxygen. The coexistence of toluene and NO has a synergistic effect, with NO accelerating the release of intermediate products during toluene degradation and freeing up active sites. Additionally, these intermediates can react with NO. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights for plasma-assisted catalytic removal of VOCs and NOx. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dbd; Mn-based Spinel; Plasma-catalytic Performance; Vocs And No; Ammonium Hydroxide; Reaction Intermediates; Sol-gel Process; Catalytic Performance; Dbd; Lattice Oxygen; Mn-based Spinel; Oxidation Of Toluenes; Plasma-catalytic Performance; Spinel Catalyst; Volatile Organic Compound And No; Volatile Organics; Nitrogen Oxides","Ammonium hydroxide; Reaction intermediates; Sol-gel process; Catalytic performance; DBD; Lattice oxygen; Mn-based spinel; Oxidation of toluenes; Plasma-catalytic performance; Spinel catalyst; Volatile organic compound and NO; Volatile organics; Nitrogen oxides","","","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge support from the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20221405, BK20241970).

Characterization results reveal that the NiCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-F with nanoflower structure exposes more surface oxygen vacancies (Ov), inducing local charge redistribution and forming active regions.

Catalytic oxidation over perovskite-type catalysts is an attractive technological approach for efficient VOC abatement. This review systematically evaluates the advancements in perovskite-based catalysts for VOC oxidation, focusing on their crystal structure–activity relationships, electronic properties, synthetic methodologies, and nanostructure engineering. Emphasis is placed on metal ion doping strategies and supported catalyst configurations, which have been demonstrated to optimize catalytic performance through synergistic effects.

The study uses the AERMOD dispersion model to predict the ground-level atmospheric TVOC emissions over 1-h, 8-h, 24-h, and annual periods under average and peak flow-rate scenarios. The effects of winter and summer seasons on TVOC dispersion were also analyzed by generating seasonal dispersion maps. The significant findings indicate that maximum TVOC concentrations are confined within the Dhahran North Sewage Treatment Plant (NSTP) area, attributed to low release heights from aeration and settling tanks. TVOC concentrations during the summer were approximately 6.8% higher than the annual average due to lower wind speeds, while winter winds enhanced dispersion, resulting in an 8.7% decrease in TVOC concentrations. The study shows that TVOC levels decrease with distance from the source, following linear and logarithmic patterns. Comparison with wastewater treatment plants in other regions demonstrates that Dhahran NSTP has lower TVOC concentrations, highlighting the influence of influent characteristics on emission levels. The strong correlation between influent flowrate and TVOC concentrations reinforces the consistency of the findings with similar facilities. The study findings indicate that the predicted atmospheric dispersion of TVOC from Dhahran NSTP may not pose a health risk to treatment plant employees and the public residing within the selected receptor domain. This supports the efficacy of the implemented air quality management practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aermod; Dispersion Modeling; Tvoc; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Ammonia; Nitrate; Nitrite; Ozone; Qgis Desktop Software Version 3.34.9; Quality Management; Risk Management; Sewage Aeration; Sewage Treatment Plants; Aermod; Dispersion Models; Ground Level; Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants; Saudi Arabia; Sewage-treatment Plants; Total Volatile Organic Compounds; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; Volatile Organics; Waste Water Treatment Plants; Air Quality; Ammonia; Nitrate; Nitrite; Organic Matter; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Quality; Concentration (composition); Dispersion; Modeling; Peak Flow; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Wind Velocity; Aeration; Air Pollution; Article; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Climate Change; Correlation Coefficient; Data Processing; Dispersion Modeling; Environmental Temperature; Flow Rate; Health Hazard; Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant; Meteorological Phenomena; Model; Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plan; Petrochemical Wastewater Treatment Plan; Ph; Pollution Control; Prediction; Seasonal Variation; Sedimentation; Sewage Treatment Plant; Summer; Suspended Particulate Matter; Temperature; Turbidity; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Wastewater; Wind Speed; Winter","Quality management; Risk management; Sewage aeration; Sewage treatment plants; AERMOD; Dispersion models; Ground level; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Saudi Arabia; Sewage-treatment plants; Total volatile organic compounds; Volatile organic compound emission; Volatile organics; Waste water treatment plants; Air quality; ammonia; nitrate; nitrite; organic matter; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; concentration (composition); dispersion; modeling; peak flow; wastewater treatment plant; wind velocity; aeration; air pollution; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; climate change; correlation coefficient; data processing; dispersion modeling; environmental temperature; flow rate; health hazard; industrial wastewater treatment plant; meteorological phenomena; model; municipal wastewater treatment plan; petrochemical wastewater treatment plan; pH; pollution control; prediction; seasonal variation; sedimentation; sewage treatment plant; summer; suspended particulate matter; temperature; turbidity; volatile organic compound emission; waste water treatment plant; wastewater; wind speed; winter","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrate, 14797-55-8; nitrite, 14797-65-0; ozone, 10028-15-6","This study was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University under grant number 2016\u2013557-Eng.","Anil, Ismail, The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the air quality of Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, Air Quality, Atmosphere and Health, 14, 1, pp. 117-128, (2021); Atasoy-Aytis, Elif A., The estimation of NMVOC emissions from an urban-scale wastewater treatment plant, Water Research, 38, 14-15, pp. 3265-3274, (2004); Behnami, Ali Karimzadeh, A systematic approach for selecting an optimal strategy for controlling VOCs emissions in a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 33, 1, pp. 13-29, (2019); Burgués, Javier, Characterization of odour emissions in a wastewater treatment plant using a drone-based chemical sensor system, Science of the Total Environment, 846, (2022); Byliński, Hubert, Evaluation of health hazard due to emission of volatile organic compounds from various processing units of wastewater treatment plant, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 10, (2019); Capelli, Laura, Measuring odours in the environment vs. dispersion modelling: A review, Atmospheric Environment, 79, pp. 731-743, (2013); Carrera-Chapela, Fabio, Modeling the odor generation in WWTP: An integrated approach review, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 225, 6, (2014); Journal of Environmental Protection and Ecology, (2017); Coelho, Monique Silva, Air Quality Impact Estimation Due to Uncontrolled Emissions from Capuava Petrochemical Complex in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP), Brazil, Atmosphere, 14, 3, (2023); Ekmekçioğlu, Araks, Effect of the low sulphur regulations of maritime fuels on ambient air quality: a case study in the Bosphorus strait, International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 22, 6, pp. 4495-4502, (2025)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","00496979; 15732932","","WAPLA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001582359"

Since the deep oxidation of the butyl acetate (BA) molecule requires the involvement of a large amount of reactive oxygen species, the catalytic oxidation of BA was promoted by weakening the Co-O bond strength on the cobalt oxide surface. In this study, we adopted a simple sacrificial template approach to fabricate a series of specifically shaped and uniform Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalysts for the catalytic oxidation of BA. The flaky CM71-C catalyst showed the best catalytic properties for BA oxidation (T<inf>50</inf> = 197 °C, T<inf>90</inf> = 215 °C). According to the characterization results, flaky CM71-C has the largest specific surface area and the weakest Co-O bond, which is more conducive to redox and oxygen activation capabilities of the catalyst. The results of in situ DRIFTS studies showed that the surface reactive oxygen species were continuously recharged during the reaction due to the higher oxygen activation capacity, which accelerated the rapid decomposition of carboxylate, a key reactive intermediate species in the deep oxidation of BA. This study provides a practical and effective way to gain insight into the role of oxygen vacancies in the preparation of efficient catalysts with a specific morphology for the oxidation of VOCs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetic Acid; Cobalt; Oxygen; Catalysts; Chemical Activation; Cobalt Compounds; Morphology; Odor Control; Organic Coatings; Oxygen Vacancies; Reaction Intermediates; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compounds; Acetate Oxidation; Butyl Acetate; Catalytic Performance; Deep Oxidation; Odor Pollution; Oxygen Activations; Volatile Organics; Water-borne Coatings; ]+ Catalyst; Catalytic Oxidation; Acetic Acid; Carboxylic Acid; Cobalt; Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Article; Catalysis; Catalyst; Chemical Bond; Controlled Study; Decomposition; Morphology; Oxidation","Catalysts; Chemical activation; Cobalt compounds; Morphology; Odor control; Organic coatings; Oxygen vacancies; Reaction intermediates; Reactive oxygen species; Volatile organic compounds; Acetate oxidation; Butyl acetate; Catalytic performance; Deep oxidation; Odor pollution; Oxygen activations; Volatile organics; Water-borne coatings; ]+ catalyst; Catalytic oxidation; acetic acid; carboxylic acid; cobalt; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; Article; catalysis; catalyst; chemical bond; controlled study; decomposition; morphology; oxidation","","acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1, 6131-90-4; cobalt, 7440-48-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22476054 and 51878293) and the National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Source Emission Control Technology (NELMS2020A06).","Chen, Jin, Homogeneous introduction of CeOy into MnOx-based catalyst for oxidation of aromatic VOCs, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 224, pp. 825-835, (2018); Jiang, Yiwen, Enhanced oxygen vacancies to improve ethyl acetate oxidation over MnOx-CeO2 catalyst derived from MOF template, Chemical Engineering Journal, 371, pp. 78-87, (2019); Lin, Jiajia, New insight into catalytic performance and reaction mechanism for butyl acetate over CeO2 catalysts: Oxygen vacancy and surface reactive oxygen species, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 12, 5, (2024); Zhao, Xiaoyu, Hierarchical porous carbon spheres using nano-ZnO as a template to remove benzene and ethyl acetate, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 12, 6, (2024); Wang, Weidong, Identification and analysis of volatile organic compound and very volatile organic compound of MDF coated with different lacquers and their health risks to humans, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 12, 2, (2024); He, Zhigui, Treatment of organic waste gas in a paint plant by combined technique of biotrickling filtration with photocatalytic oxidation, Chemical Engineering Journal, 200-202, pp. 645-653, (2012); Stockwell, Chelsea E., Volatile organic compound emissions from solvent-and water-borne coatings-compositional differences and tracer compound identifications, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 21, 8, pp. 6005-6022, (2021); Zhao, Yongjun, Photolysis of gaseous butyl acetate using built-in microwave discharge electrodeless lamps, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 186, 1, pp. 430-435, (2011); Kim, Jeong-min, Thermocatalytic oxidation of gaseous benzene by a titanium dioxide supported platinum catalyst, Chemical Engineering Journal, 428, (2022); Chen, Xi, Engineering lattice oxygen mobility and optimizing reaction pathway via tuning Cu-Co interactions for efficient elimination of volatile organic compounds: A metal–organic framework template approach, Separation and Purification Technology, 338, (2024)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","13699261; 11440546","","NJCHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008027279"

The PCD efficiency of BiOCl-R against 5 ppm toluene (20 % relative humidity (RH)) is 98.6 % under ultraviolet light irradiation with the quantum yield and clean air delivery rate of 1.04E-03 molecules photon-1 and 3 L/h, respectively. A combined evaluation of catalyst properties, experimental data, and density functional theory simulations consistently indicates that the formation of surface defects should promote the adsorption and activation of toluene, molecular oxygen (O<inf>2</inf>), and water (H<inf>2</inf>O) molecules. Meanwhile, the geometric and electronic structure of defective BiOX favorably generates superoxide anion ([rad]O<inf>2</inf>–) and hydroxyl ([rad]OH) radicals through electron (e-)-assisted O<inf>2</inf> activation and hole (h+)-mediated H<inf>2</inf>O oxidation, respectively. Notably, the BiOCl-R surface becomes more advantageous to reduce the reaction energy barrier in the ring-opening processes of intermediate forms like benzaldehyde and benzoic acid.

This study addresses remediation of toluene by developing a bifunctional nitrogen-doped biochar (NDB) activated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), aimed at reducing toluene emissions through both adsorption and catalytic oxidation. A series of NDB samples were prepared via NaOH activation and pyrolysis at varying temperatures to optimize their adsorption capacity and catalytic performance. The results demonstrated that NaOH-activated NDB exhibits substantial mesopore volumes and excellent surface area, with adsorption performance highly dependent on surface area and catalytic performance strongly influenced by nitrogen species. The dynamic adsorption tests revealed that BUN-900 achieved an outstanding toluene adsorption capacity of 422.25 mg/g, attributed to its high specific surface area of 1321.72 m2/g. In contrast, BU-800 showed complete toluene conversion at 450 °C via catalytic oxidation, attributed to the presence of pyridinic-N species. Interestingly, while the sample with the best adsorption performance had the lowest catalytic oxidation performance, the sample with the best catalytic performance exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity. This study demonstrates that NaOH activation and nitrogen doping can significantly enhance the bifunctional properties of biochar, positioning it as a promising, sustainable material for VOC control through combined adsorption and catalytic oxidation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Bifunctional Material; Catalytic Oxidation; Nitrogen Species; Nitrogen-doped Biochar; Toluene Removal; Charcoal; Nitrogen; Sodium Hydroxide; Toluene; Air Pollutants; Biochar; Charcoal; Nitrogen; Sodium Hydroxide; Toluene; Air Pollution; Biohazards; Catalytic Oxidation; Toluene; Adsorption Capacities; Bi-functional; Bifunctional Materials; Biochar; Catalytic Performance; Nitrogen Species; Nitrogen-doped; Nitrogen-doped Biochar; Toluene Removal; Volatile Organics; Emission Control; Charcoal; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Derivative; Pyridine Derivative; Sodium Hydroxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Adsorption; Biochar; Catalysis; Design Method; Emission Control; Oxidation; Pollutant Removal; Pyrolysis; Air Pollutant; Air Pollution Control; Article; Bioremediation; Controlled Study; Desorption; Environmental Risk; Physical Chemistry; Pore Size Distribution; Pore Volume; Reaction Analysis; Surface Area; Chemistry; Ecosystem Restoration; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Procedures; Adsorption; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration And Remediation; Nitrogen; Oxidation-reduction; Sodium Hydroxide","Air pollution; Biohazards; Catalytic oxidation; Toluene; Adsorption capacities; Bi-functional; Bifunctional materials; Biochar; Catalytic performance; Nitrogen species; Nitrogen-doped; Nitrogen-doped biochar; Toluene removal; Volatile organics; Emission control; charcoal; nitrogen; nitrogen derivative; pyridine derivative; sodium hydroxide; toluene; volatile organic compound; adsorption; biochar; catalysis; design method; emission control; oxidation; pollutant removal; pyrolysis; air pollutant; air pollution control; Article; bioremediation; controlled study; desorption; environmental risk; physical chemistry; pore size distribution; pore volume; reaction analysis; surface area; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; oxidation reduction reaction; procedures; Adsorption; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Charcoal; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Sodium Hydroxide","","charcoal, 16291-96-6; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2; toluene, 108-88-3; Air Pollutants; biochar; Charcoal; Nitrogen; Sodium Hydroxide; Toluene","This work was supported by research fund of Chungnam National University.","Bader, Richard Frederick William, A Quantum Theory of Molecular Structure and Its Applications, Chemical Reviews, 91, 5, pp. 893-928, (1991); Blöchl, Peter E., Projector augmented-wave method, Physical Review B-Condensed Matter, 50, 24, pp. 17953-17979, (1994); Carabineiro, Sónia A.C., Gold supported on metal oxides for volatile organic compounds total oxidation, Catalysis Today, 244, pp. 103-114, (2015); Chen, Ping, Nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon nanosheets derived from plant biomass: An efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, Energy and Environmental Science, 7, 12, pp. 4095-4103, (2014); Chen, Wei, Transformation of Nitrogen and Evolution of N-Containing Species during Algae Pyrolysis, Environmental Science and Technology, 51, 11, pp. 6570-6579, (2017); Cheng, Tangying, Nitrogen-doped porous biochar for selective adsorption of toluene under humid conditions, Fuel, 334, (2023); Dumont, Éric, VOC absorption in a countercurrent packed-bed column using water/silicone oil mixtures: Influence of silicone oil volume fraction, Chemical Engineering Journal, 168, 1, pp. 241-248, (2011); Gil, Roberto Rodríguez, VOCs removal by adsorption onto activated carbons from biocollagenic wastes of vegetable tanning, Chemical Engineering Journal, 245, pp. 80-88, (2014); Huang, Haibao, Byproducts and pathways of toluene destruction via plasma-catalysis, Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 336, 1-2, pp. 87-93, (2011); Huang, Jing, Efficient α-MnO2 with (2 1 0) facet exposed for catalytic oxidation of toluene at low temperature: A combined in-situ DRIFTS and theoretical investigation, Chemosphere, 263, (2021)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10960953; 00139351","","ENVRA","39832543","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215622777"

Among the strategies to mitigate exhaust gases, biological treatment technology has gained significant attention due to its high treatment efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. This technology has become a key area of research. This paper discusses the principles, scope, advantages, and cons of various biological treatment methods, including biofiltration, biotrickling filtration, bioscrubbing, and membrane bioreactors. Noteworthy advantages of current biological treatment for exhaust gases include cost savings, reduced energy consumption, and lower secondary pollution risks. However, limitations exist, such as the treatment of treating low concentration and high flow rate of exhaust gases, and the dependence on specific microbial species and fillers. Combining biological treatments with other technologies could significantly improve effectiveness.

Catalytic oxidation is a promising method to eliminate air pollution due to its high efficiency, wide application range, and environmental friendliness. However, in the actual industrial environment, the composition of industrial exhaust gases is complex, including VOCs, water vapour, chloride, sulfide and so on. The impurities would have competitive adsorption with reactants or react with the active sites, leading to the decline of catalytic activity, even the deactivation of catalysts. Therefore, this review summarises the recent research on the anti-poisoning ability of catalysts in the catalytic oxidation of VOCs, primarily focusing on the effect of water vapour, chloride, and sulfide. The catalytic oxidation mechanism manifested that the adsorption and activation of reactants are significant in VOCs degradation. On this basis, the mechanism of catalyst poisoning was analysed, and the inhibitory effect of impurities on the oxidation reaction was elucidated. According to the research status, three anti-poisoning strategies are proposed, including building a bimetallic system, modifying supports, and establishing the protected coating. This work provides a theoretical foundation and reference point for the rational construction of anti-poisoning catalysts in VOCs elimination. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Immobilization; Catalyst Poisoning Mechanism; Homogeneous Catalysis; The Anti-poisoning Catalysts; Vocs Catalytic Oxidation; Bioremediation; Catalysis; Catalytic Oxidation; Exhaust Gases; Catalyst Immobilization; Catalyst Poisoning Mechanism; Homogeneous Catalysis; Poisoning Mechanisms; Recent Researches; The Anti-poisoning Catalyst; Volatile Organic Compound Catalytic Oxidation; Volatile Organics; ]+ Catalyst; Chlorine Compounds","Bioremediation; Catalysis; Catalytic oxidation; Exhaust gases; Catalyst immobilization; Catalyst poisoning mechanism; Homogeneous catalysis; Poisoning mechanisms; Recent researches; The anti-poisoning catalyst; Volatile organic compound catalytic oxidation; Volatile organics; ]+ catalyst; Chlorine compounds","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22406049, 42130606, 22076192 and 42175133), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (GZC20240432), Jing-Jin-Ji Regional Integrated Environmental Improvement-National Science and Technology Major Project (2024ZD1200402).","Zhang, Xueyang, Adsorption of VOCs onto engineered carbon materials: A review, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 338, pp. 102-123, (2017); Carroll, Gregory T., A Peripherally Located Air Recirculation Device Containing an Activated Carbon Filter Reduces VOC Levels in a Simulated Operating Room, ACS Omega, 7, 50, pp. 46640-46645, (2022); Mangotra, Anju, Volatile organic compounds: A threat to the environment and health hazards to living organisms – A review, Journal of Biotechnology, 382, pp. 51-69, (2024); He, Chi, Recent Advances in the Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds: A Review Based on Pollutant Sorts and Sources, Chemical Reviews, 119, 7, pp. 4471-4568, (2019); Kamal, Muhammad Shahzad, Catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - A review, Atmospheric Environment, 140, pp. 117-134, (2016); Sun, W., Long-Term Trends of Anthropogenic SO2, NOx, CO, and NMVOCs Emissions in China, Earth's Future, 6, 8, pp. 1112-1133, (2018); Verma, Neha, Occupational health hazards and wide spectrum of genetic damage by the organic solvent fumes at the workplace: A critical appraisal, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 21, pp. 30954-30966, (2022); Armenta-Reséndiz, Monserrat, Structure-activity study of acute neurobehavioral effects of cyclohexane, benzene, m-xylene, and toluene in rats, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 376, pp. 38-45, (2019); Liu, Yishui, Rational Design and Preparation of Pt-LDH/CeO2Catalyst for High-Efficiency Photothermal Catalytic Oxidation of Toluene, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 14, 32, pp. 36633-36643, (2022); Ma, Xiuyun, Boosting benzene combustion by engineering oxygen vacancy-mediated Ag/CeO2-Co3O4 catalyst via interfacial electron transfer, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 594, pp. 882-890, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20734344","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000844441"

However, supported metal nanoparticle coalescence or sintering is inevitable and a cause for catalyst deactivation. While reversing the sintering process is challenging, it is an essential topic as this would further extend catalyst use and reduce the consumption of critical raw materials often used in catalysts, e.g., noble metals. The cyclic oxidation-reduction of supported metal nanoparticles is commonly reported as a method for redispersing supported metal nanoparticles. While multiple molecules can be used to reduce supported metal oxide nanoparticles, H<inf>2</inf> is the primary reducing agent used when performing redispersion via oxidation/reduction. Yet, replacing the H<inf>2</inf> with other organic molecules could significantly impact the redispersion phenomena as it is well-known that metal nanoparticles' configuration is affected by molecular adsorption. Herein, we explored organic molecules as reducing agents to reduce silica-supported ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO<inf>2</inf>/SiO<inf>2</inf>). Six compounds were evaluated: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, heptane, and cyclohexane, and the results were compared to the conventional reduction with H<inf>2</inf>. The products and the energy released showed two pathways: (i) conversion of RuO<inf>2</inf> to metallic Ru due to oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidation of the reducing agents, and (ii) dehydrogenation of the organic molecules when enough metallic Ru is available. The energy released during reduction was substantially lower with organic molecules (27-85 kJ mol<inf>RuO<inf>2</inf></inf>−1), as opposed to H<inf>2</inf> (156 kJ mol<inf>RuO<inf>2</inf></inf>−1). In addition, smaller Ru nanoparticles resulted from the reduction of organic molecules (4.5-7.0 nm) instead of H<inf>2</inf> (11.9 nm). This observation was attributed to a redispersion phenomenon, which was not observed when using H<inf>2</inf>, supported by the existence of clusters of small nanoparticles, which were, in turn, impacted by the kinetics of the reduction reaction. The Ru/SiO<inf>2</inf> catalyst was employed in the furfural hydrogenation reaction as a model reaction, where all catalysts reduced with organic compounds displayed a two-fold increase in activity compared to those reduced with H<inf>2</inf>. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioremediation; Catalyst Deactivation; Catalyst Supports; Coalescence; Crystallites; Cyclohexane; Dehydrogenation; Equilibrium Constants; Gels; Hydrolysis; Iron; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanocatalysts; Palladium; Rate Constants; Ruthenium Compounds; Silica Nanoparticles; Sintering; Sols; % Reductions; Energy; Metallics; Organic Molecules; Oxidation Reduction; Redispersions; Ruo 2; Sio 2; Supported Metals; ]+ Catalyst; Heptane","Bioremediation; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst supports; Coalescence; Crystallites; Cyclohexane; Dehydrogenation; Equilibrium constants; Gels; Hydrolysis; Iron; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocatalysts; Palladium; Rate constants; Ruthenium compounds; Silica nanoparticles; Sintering; Sols; % reductions; Energy; Metallics; Organic molecules; Oxidation reduction; Redispersions; RuO 2; SiO 2; Supported metals; ]+ catalyst; Heptane","","","The authors acknowledge the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at The University of Queensland and the Central Analytical Research Facility operated by Research Infrastructure (QUT).

The study addresses the growing need for efficient air purification technologies by integrating advanced oxidation processes. Metal catalysts, particularly manganese oxide-based materials, were combined with photocatalysis and ozonation to investigate their impact on acetaldehyde removal efficiency. Experimental results revealed that the treatment integrating these methods significantly outperformed conventional single-process treatments. Metal catalysts facilitated the initial oxidation of acetaldehyde, while photocatalysis accelerated subsequent stages, including the mineralisation of intermediates. Ozone contributed additional reactive oxidative species, further enhancing decomposition rates. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of efficient VOC removal systems, demonstrating that integrating metal catalysts with photocatalytic and ozonation processes offers a promising strategy for improving air purification technologies.

A promising and environment-friendly technology for this purpose involves the use of electrons as clean energy or solvents. The field of electrochemical abatement of air pollutants using electrons has made significant progress in recent years, particularly in terms of solid-gas electrochemical reactions within suitable cell assemblies. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the absorption of gaseous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into liquids involved in electrochemical abatement at the solid-liquid or liquid-gas interfaces. Techniques such as electroscrubbing, which use electrically charged ions for the treatment of flue gases, odor gases, and VOCs with wet scrubbers, are explored. Advances in the abatement of gaseous pollutants include the development of tri-phase interfaces using gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) in electrochemical cell assemblies, which have subsequently progressed to membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) in all-solid-cell configurations. A recent innovation involves a half-cell approach that eliminates the need for liquid electrolytes and minimizes humidity supply to the gaseous pollutant stream. This review highlights the importance of mediators or catalysts at the liquid-gas and solid-gas interfaces in improving the effectiveness of air pollutant abatement. Furthermore, a potential application of a gel membrane design for a liquid-electrolyte-free one-half-cell configuration is suggested, which could facilitate the abatement of gaseous pollutants at solid-gas electrochemical interfaces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gel Membrane; Liquid Electrolyte; Liquid-gas Interface; Solid-gas Interface; Solid-liquid Interface; Air Cleaners; Air Pollution; Diffusion In Gases; Electrolytic Cleaning; Gas Permeable Membranes; Positive Ions; River Pollution; Air Pollutants; Cell Assembly; Electrochemicals; Gaseous Pollutants; Gel Membranes; Liquid Electrolytes; Liquid Gas Interface; Solid-liquid Interfaces; Solid/gas Interface; Volatile Organics","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Diffusion in gases; Electrolytic cleaning; Gas permeable membranes; Positive ions; River pollution; Air pollutants; Cell assembly; Electrochemicals; Gaseous pollutants; Gel membranes; Liquid electrolytes; Liquid gas interface; Solid-liquid interfaces; Solid/gas Interface; Volatile organics","","","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (Grant No.: NRF-2023R1A2C2003796; NRF-2020R1A6A1A03042742).","undefined; Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, (2009); Mannucci, Piermannuccio Mannuccio M., Health effects of ambient air pollution in developing countries, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14, 9, (2017); Saud, Trailokya, Emission estimates of organic and elemental carbon from household biomass fuel used over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), India, Atmospheric Environment, 61, pp. 212-220, (2012); Singh, Dharam Pal, Emissions estimates of PAH from biomass fuels used in rural sector of Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, Atmospheric Environment, 68, pp. 120-126, (2013); Kassomenos, Pavlos, Air quality assessment in a heavily polluted urban Mediterranean environment through air quality indices, Ecological Indicators, 18, pp. 259-268, (2012); Burroughs Peña, Melissa Suzanne, Environmental Exposures and Cardiovascular Disease: A Challenge for Health and Development in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, Cardiology Clinics, 35, 1, pp. 71-86, (2017); undefined, (2015); Huang, Haibao, VUV photo-oxidation of gaseous benzene combined with ozone-assisted catalytic oxidation: Effect on transition metal catalyst, Applied Surface Science, 391, pp. 662-667, (2017); Shu, Yajie, Promotional role of Mn doping on catalytic oxidation of VOCs over mesoporous TiO2 under vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 220, pp. 78-87, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22133437","","","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212939359"

Oxidative catalysis has emerged as a highly effective strategy for treating VOCs, and zeolite-based materials have proven to be efficient catalysts for such reactions. To date, zeolite-based materials are acknowledged as promising candidates for VOC oxidation, leveraging their meritorious properties, including unique structures, large surface areas, high adsorption capacity, uniform/intricate channels, high thermal stability, wettability, and well-defined micropores with excellent shape selectivity. This review comprehensively outlines the potential utility of zeolite-based catalysts, encompassing their types, adsorption, and catalysis mechanisms. Various research methods, such as adsorption–desorption, selective catalytic reduction, oxidation, isomerization, cracking, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, peroxidation, and photocatalysis, employed in zeolite-assisted catalysis of VOCs, are also discussed. Furthermore, the review delves into the effects of feed gas composition, feed gas flow rate, reaction temperature, and zeolite type on the catalytic process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysis; Vocs; Zeolite; Zeolite-based Hetero-catalysts; Bioremediation; Catalytic Cracking; Catalytic Oxidation; Isomerization; Photocatalysis; Air Pollutants; Catalyse; Catalytic Treatment; Gaseous Media; Heterogeneous Catalyst; Human Health; Liquid Media; Volatile Organics; Zeolite-based Hetero-catalyst; ]+ Catalyst; Selective Catalytic Reduction","Bioremediation; Catalytic cracking; Catalytic oxidation; Isomerization; Photocatalysis; Air pollutants; Catalyse; Catalytic treatment; Gaseous media; Heterogeneous catalyst; Human health; Liquid media; Volatile organics; Zeolite-based hetero-catalyst; ]+ catalyst; Selective catalytic reduction","","","","Iium Eng J, (2006); Ali, Syed Ashar, Surface coupling of plasma optical emission spectra with bent metal-clad waveguide, Optical and Quantum Electronics, 51, 2, (2019); Aranzábal, Asier, Stability of protonic zeolites in the catalytic oxidation of chlorinated VOCs (1,2-dichloroethane), Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 88, 3-4, pp. 533-541, (2009); Ukr J Phys Opt, (2017); Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric chemistry of VOCs and NO(x), Atmospheric Environment, 34, 12-14, pp. 2063-2101, (2000); Azarpour, Abbas, Performance analysis and modeling of catalytic trickle-bed reactors: a comprehensive review, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 103, pp. 1-41, (2021); Baek, Se-won, Design of dual functional adsorbent/catalyst system for the control of VOC's by using metal-loaded hydrophobic Y-zeolites, Catalysis Today, 93-95, pp. 575-581, (2004); Blanch-Raga, Neus, Cu and Co modified beta zeolite catalysts for the trichloroethylene oxidation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 187, pp. 90-97, (2016); Chang, Cheng, Recent Progress on Two-Dimensional Materials, Wuli Huaxue Xuebao/ Acta Physico - Chimica Sinica, 37, 12, (2021); Chen, Chunyu, Superior performance in catalytic combustion of toluene over KZSM-5 zeolite supported platinum catalyst, Catalysis Letters, 144, 11, pp. 1851-1859, (2014)","","Begell House Inc.","","","","","","21514798; 2151562X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217264731"

Biological treatment is emerging as a promising strategy for VOCs removal due to its low energy consumption and minimal potential for secondary pollution. Biofiltration systems offer an efficient technology, characterized by their straightforward operation and low energy requirements. The effectiveness of biofiltration systems is influenced by the nature, composition, and community structure of the microorganisms within the biofilm that develops on the medium. However, hydrophobic VOCs present a particular challenge for degradation due to their complex structures and strong affinity for organic materials. This hydrophobicity limits their bioavailability, making it difficult for microorganisms to access and metabolize these compounds effectively. Furthermore, hydrophobic VOCs tend to adsorb onto surfaces rather than dissolving in aqueous environments, complicating their degradation in biological treatment systems. This paper reviews recent advancements in VOCs treatment technologies, with a particular focus on hydrophobic VOCs and innovations in biofiltration that integrate photolysis, photocatalysis, non-thermal plasma (NTP), and electrochemical treatment. Additionally, it addresses current challenges and future prospects for optimizing biofiltration performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Biofilm; Bioreactors; Integrated Systems; Vocs","","","","","Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric chemistry of VOCs and NO(x), Atmospheric Environment, 34, 12-14, pp. 2063-2101, (2000); Kong, Ning, Ruthenium Nanoparticles Supported on Mg(OH)2 Microflowers as Catalysts for Photothermal Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation, ACS Applied Nano Materials, 3, 3, pp. 3028-3033, (2020); Pagans, Estela La, Emission of volatile organic compounds from composting of different solid wastes: Abatement by biofiltration, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 131, 1-3, pp. 179-186, (2006); Font, Xavier, Detection, composition and treatment of volatile organic compounds from waste treatment plants, Sensors, 11, 4, pp. 4043-4059, (2011); Ho, Kin Fai, Identification of atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonyl compounds in Hong Kong, Science of the Total Environment, 289, 1-3, pp. 145-158, (2002); Montero, M.

The RVR has properties that are crucial for their synergistic effects with the MPT, and the POF configurations showed high-efficiency combustion due to plasma radicals and a large contact area with the MPT. The study used Aspen Plus and COMSOL software to analyse the mass balance involved in the thermal decomposition of isopropyl alcohol (C₃H₈O) and CF<inf>4</inf> and to design the RVR and POF reactors. Using MPT without hydrocarbon fuel, low-concentration C₃H₈O and CF<inf>4</inf> were successfully destroyed in high-flow streams. The experiment on C₃H₈O showed that using a plasma power of 2 kW and 1 cubic meter per minute (CMM) of bulk gas, a destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of 95 % was achieved for a polluted C₃H₈O of 410 ppm. In a second experiment, a DRE of 94 % was achieved for a polluted C₃H₈O of 370 ppm. The first CF<inf>4</inf> experiment achieved a DRE of 93.3 % with a 7 kW plasma power and 1 CMM bulk gas polluted at 285 ppm. In the second experiment, the presence of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH*) in steam plasma improved the DRE to 99.8 % at 7 kW plasma power and 100 LPM bulk polluted at 180 ppm. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition Of Fluorine Gases; Destruction Removal Efficiency; Direct Burning Of Voc; Microwave Plasma Torch; Pillar Of Fire (pof); Reverse Vortex Flow Reactor (rvr); Bioremediation; Catalytic Cracking; Fluorine Compounds; Parametric Devices; Plasma Display Devices; Plasma Torches; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Reverse Combustion; Decomposition Of Fluorine Gas; Destruction Removal Efficiency; Direct Burning Of Volatile Organic Compound; Fluorine Gas; Microwave Plasma Torch; Pillar Of Fire; Removal Efficiencies; Reverse Vortex Flow Reactor; Reverse Vortex Flows; Volatile Organics; Vortex Flow Reactors; Vortex Flow","Bioremediation; Catalytic cracking; Fluorine compounds; Parametric devices; Plasma display devices; Plasma torches; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reverse combustion; Decomposition of fluorine gas; Destruction removal efficiency; Direct burning of volatile organic compound; Fluorine gas; Microwave plasma torch; Pillar of fire; Removal efficiencies; Reverse vortex flow reactor; Reverse vortex flows; Volatile organics; Vortex flow reactors; Vortex flow","","","","Chaichumporn, C., Design and construction of 2.45 GHz microwave plasma source at atmospheric pressure, Procedia Engineering, 8, pp. 94-100, (2011); Chen, Hsinliang, Kinetic modeling of the NF3 decomposition via dielectric barrier discharges in N2/NF3 mixtures, Plasma Processes and Polymers, 3, 9, pp. 682-691, (2006); Chung, Wei Chieh, Dry reforming of methane with dielectric barrier discharge and ferroelectric packed-bed reactors, Energy and Fuels, 28, 12, pp. 7621-7631, (2014); de la Fuente, Javier F., Microwave plasma emerging technologies for chemical processes, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 92, 10, pp. 2495-2505, (2017); Fridman, A.

Catalytic ozonation technology effectively degrades PX at low temperatures. The oxygen vacancy density and surface acidity of Mn<inf>x</inf>Ce<inf>y</inf>O catalysts were modulated using a microemulsion method. The results revealed that the structural defects formed in the Mn/Ce composite oxides enhanced the oxygen vacancies on the catalysts. By adjusting the Mn/Ce molar ratio and the W/O (water/oil) mass ratio in the microemulsion, Mn<inf>x</inf>Ce<inf>y</inf>O catalysts enriched with oxygen vacancies and surface acidic sites were obtained. The optimal microemulsion conditions were identified as a Mn/Ce molar ratio of 1 and a W/O mass ratio of 0.2. The catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance, achieving p-xylene (PX) conversion and mineralization rates of approximately 100% and 72%, respectively.

This study investigated a highly efficient approach to the catalytic oxidation of low- concentration toluene, offering a practical and impactful solution for improving indoor air quality. Despite the increasing attention to toluene emissions, research on the catalytic oxidation of low-concentration toluene remains limited. To address this gap, the catalytic performance of La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> catalysts synthesized via hydrothermal methods was evaluated. La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> catalysts with various morphologies (particles, flowers, rods, and sheets) were successfully synthesized. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that both the precursor materials and hydrothermal synthesis temperature significantly influenced catalyst crystallinity. Among the four morphologies, La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets (NS) exhibited the lowest crystallinity, which likely resulted in more surface defects, thus enhancing catalytic activity. La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets exhibited a highly porous surface with a combination of high specific surface area, mesopores, and a small fraction of micropores, facilitating the effective adsorption of low-concentration toluene. Additionally, the NS catalyst showed a significantly higher Mn3+ / Mn4+ ratio compared to the other morphologies, which facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies. The ratio of lattice oxygen to adsorbed oxygen was nearly identical for the NS, and the lower desorption temperature of lattice oxygen further promoted the conversion of toluene to benzoate. The catalytic activity for low-concentration toluene oxidation followed this order: La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets > La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles > La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanowires > La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanoflowers. Notably, the La-doped NS catalyst exhibited a higher proportion of Mn3+ and better catalytic performance than the undoped catalysts. At 40 ℃, the NS catalyst achieved a 40% toluene removal rate, demonstrating excellent durability and reusability. The NS catalyst maintained strong catalytic performance during both the initial and long-term stages, providing a reliable foundation for practical applications. Further testing revealed that, at 200 ℃, the La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets achieved up to 90% toluene removal and maintained stable catalytic activity for up to 11 h. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the combination of La doping and the sheet-like structure promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies and low-valence manganese, which played a crucial role in enhancing the oxidation process and facilitating the transformation of oxygen species. In conclusion, the La/ MnO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets, especially with La doping, exhibited excellent catalytic performance, stability, and reusability, highlighting their strong potential for removing indoor VOCs such as toluene. With their promising catalytic activity and durability, further research into their scalability for large-scale air purification applications is highly encouraged. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Morphology; Catalytic Oxidation; La/ Mno2; Toluene","","","","","Wang, Qifan, VOCs and Odor Emission from Lacquer Veneer Particleboards, Linye Kexue/Scientia Silvae Sinicae, 56, 5, pp. 130-142, (2020); Zhao, Qun, Interaction of inhalable volatile organic compounds and pulmonary surfactant: Potential hazards of VOCs exposure to lung, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 369, pp. 512-520, (2019); Shandong Chemical Industry, (2023); Yang, Cuiting, Abatement of various types of VOCs by adsorption/catalytic oxidation: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 370, pp. 1128-1153, (2019); Song, Zhengguo, Synthesis and characterization of a novel MnOx-loaded biochar and its adsorption properties for Cu2+ in aqueous solution, Chemical Engineering Journal, 242, pp. 36-42, (2014); Zhang, Yong, Preparation process optimization and properties of manganese dioxide micro/nano spheres and microrods, Beijing Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of University of Science and Technology Beijing, 35, 10, pp. 1353-1359, (2013); Fang, Ruimei, Excellent stability for catalytic oxidation formaldehyde over defective δ-MnO2nanoparticles at room temperature, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 11, 1, (2023); Yücel, Murat, Toluene misuse and long-term harms: A systematic review of the neuropsychological and neuroimaging literature, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 32, 5, pp. 910-926, (2008); Hermia, Jacques, Catalytic incineration for odour abatement and VOC destruction, Catalysis Today, 17, 1-2, pp. 349-358, (1993); Huang, Jing, Efficient α-MnO2 with (2 1 0) facet exposed for catalytic oxidation of toluene at low temperature: A combined in-situ DRIFTS and theoretical investigation, Chemosphere, 263, (2021)","","Nanjing Forestry University","","","","","","20961359","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005752509"

Herein, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) technology was used as a pre-treatment technology, and the effect of process parameters (specific input of energy (SIE), inlet concentration of CB, humidity, and discharge length) of DBD on the removal performance of CB was analyzed, in order to investigate the feasibility of DBD as a pre-treatment approach for bio-purification. Taking energy yield, by-product analysis and exhaust evaluation as considerations, an SIE of 1,131.57 J·L-1, an inlet CB concentration of 300 ppm, a humidity of 50 %, and a discharge length of 10 cm were selected as the most suitable experimental conditions for the air DBD reactor. The temperature of gas flow was analyzed. Results suggested that DBD have no adverse thermal effect on the subsequent biotechnology (decreased by about 8 K during the discharge process). The temperature change caused by the degradation of CB (e.g., phenyl ring-opening and other processes) accounts for about 90 % of the total temperature change, where remaining part of temperature decreased caused by the large number of active substances produced by electron excitation, collision and cracking during discharge. The regulation of short-life active substances (e.g., ·NO, ·NO<inf>2</inf>,·OH, and O<inf>2</inf>–·) further reduced the toxicity of the outlet gas generated by DBD through affect the contents the long-life active substances (e.g., H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>). This study provides a better understanding of the feasibility of DBD as a treatment for bio-purification and a new coupling technology for the effective removal of CB. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Substances; Biotoxicity; Cb Removal; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Air Cleaners; Biodegradation; Chemicals Removal (water Treatment); Active Substance; Biotoxicity; Chlorobenzene Removal; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasmas; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Energy; Pre-treatments; Removal Performance; Temperature Changes; Volatile Organics; Dielectric Barrier Discharge","Air cleaners; Biodegradation; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Active substance; Biotoxicity; Chlorobenzene removal; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Dielectric barrier discharges; Energy; Pre-treatments; Removal performance; Temperature changes; Volatile organics; Dielectric barrier discharge","","","This work was supported by the National Key R and D Program of China [grant number 2022YFC3702000].","Abedi, Kamaladdin Ad Din, Decomposition of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) using NTP coupled with TiO2/GAC, ZnO/GAC, and TiO2-ZnO/GAC in a plasma-assisted catalysis system, Journal of Electrostatics, 73, pp. 80-88, (2015); Acayanka, Elie, Evaluation of Energy Balance in a Batch and Circulating Non-thermal Plasma Reactors During Organic Pollutant Oxidation in Aqueous Solution, Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 39, 1, pp. 75-87, (2019); Abd-Allah, Zaenab, Remediation of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) using non-thermal, atmospheric pressure plasma generated in a packed-bed reactor, Environmental Science and Technology, 48, 1, pp. 558-565, (2014); Ansari, Mohsen, Dielectric barrier discharge plasma combined with nano catalyst for aqueous amoxicillin removal: Performance modeling, kinetics and optimization study, energy yield, degradation pathway, and toxicity, Separation and Purification Technology, 251, (2020); Chemical Engineering Journal Lausanne, (2016); Bo, Zheng, Vertically-oriented graphenes supported Mn 3 O 4 as advanced catalysts in post plasma-catalysis for toluene decomposition, Applied Surface Science, 436, pp. 570-578, (2018); Chang, Chungliang, Destruction of styrene in an air stream by packed dielectric barrier discharge reactors, Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 25, 6, pp. 641-657, (2005); Chang, Tian, Post-plasma-catalytic removal of toluene using MnO2-Co3O4 catalysts and their synergistic mechanism, Chemical Engineering Journal, 348, pp. 15-25, (2018); Chang, Tian, Simulation and optimization of the post plasma-catalytic system for toluene degradation by a hybrid ANN and NSGA-II method, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 244, pp. 107-119, (2019); Chawdhury, Piu, Methane decomposition by plasma-packed bed non-thermal plasma reactor, Chemical Engineering Science, 258, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00092509","","CESCA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202737670"

As the country enters a phase of high-quality development, with a focus on green and low-carbon initiatives, the prevention and control of soil contamination at these sites faces both challenges and new opportunities. This paper reviews progress in technologies for the prevention and remediation of contaminated industrial sites in China, evaluates current needs, and identifies ten major scientific and technical challenges across five key areas: soil environmental standards, pollution mechanisms, monitoring and regulatory technologies, remediation techniques, and decision-support systems. It highlights specific gaps, including limited scientific support for soil standards, unclear pollution mechanisms for certain contaminants, incomplete sampling and monitoring systems, insufficient green remediation technologies, and a lack of comprehensive decision-making tools. Based on China′s national conditions and global trends, the paper proposes several strategies: strengthening research on soil standards, deepening the study of pollution mechanisms, improving monitoring systems, advancing green remediation technologies, and building an information and intelligence-based decision-support system. These efforts aim to drive scientific and technological innovation, promoting coordinated development across disciplines, technologies as well as the soil remediation industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Management; Industrial Sites; Remediation; Risk Control; Soil Pollution","","","","Supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (No.2021YFC1809201); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.42077181); Self-Deployed Project during \u201814th Five-Year Plan\u2019 Period at Nanjing Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. ISSASIP2213)","Soils, (2015); Jiang, Lin, Challenges and Response to Risk Management of Complex Contaminated Sites, Research of Environmental Sciences, 34, 2, pp. 458-467, (2021); Ju, Tienan, Comprehensive risk assessment of key supervision units of soil pollution in Yangtze River Delta, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science, 43, 12, pp. 6490-6499, (2023); Luo, Yongming, Research progresses and prospects on soil pollution and remediation in china, Acta Pedologica Sinica, 57, 5, pp. 1137-1142, (2020); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2015); Long, Tao, Progress and Prospect of Soil Environmental Criteria Research in China, Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment, 39, 3, pp. 273-281, (2023); Ge, Feng, Studies on screening and list of priority pollutants in China's soil criteria research, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science, 38, 11, pp. 4228-4235, (2018); Man, Jun, Database examination, multivariate analysis, and machine learning: Predictions of vapor intrusion attenuation factors, Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, 242, (2022)","","Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences","","","","","","10016929","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213327420"

How to remove and decompose the low concentration of formaldehyde at room temperature is important for indoor environments. Catalytic ozonation is an efficient method to thoroughly remove HCHO at room temperature, with high efficiency and few byproducts. A series of MnO<inf>x</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts were prepared in this work via the impregnation method and treated with different reagents (acid, alkali, and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) to evaluate their catalytic activity for HCHO removal. The results showed that MnAl-II (acid treatment) performed well in activity tests, reaching a nearly 100% HCHO conversion at an O<inf>3</inf>/HCHO of 2.0 and attaining a CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity of above 95% at an O<inf>3</inf>/HCHO of 3.0 at 30 °C, with almost no ozone residual existing. The larger specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, and higher number of acid sites contributed to the excellent performance of MnAl-II. Stability and H<inf>2</inf>O resistance tests of MnAl-II were also conducted. To reveal the intermediate product formation and further investigate the reaction mechanism of HCHO ozonation, in-situ DRIFTS measurement was carried out combined with DFT calculations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Formaldehyde; Low Temperature; Mnox/γ-al2o3; Reaction Mechanism","","","","This research was supported by the \u201CPioneer\u201D and \u201CLeading Goose\u201D R&D Program of Zhejiang (2023C03126) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52125605).","Liang, Weihui, Long-Term Formaldehyde Emissions from Medium-Density Fiberboard in a Full-Scale Experimental Room: Emission Characteristics and the Effects of Temperature and Humidity, Environmental Science and Technology, 49, 17, pp. 10349-10356, (2015); Jiang, Chuanjia, Formaldehyde and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from particleboard: Identification of odorous compounds and effects of heat treatment, Building and Environment, 117, pp. 118-126, (2017); Salthammer, Tunga, Formaldehyde sources, formaldehyde concentrations and air exchange rates in European housings, Building and Environment, 150, pp. 219-232, (2019); Ji, Jian, Potassium-modulated δ-MnO2 as robust catalysts for formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 260, (2020); Robert, Berly, Indoor formaldehyde removal by catalytic oxidation, adsorption and nanofibrous membranes: a review, Environmental Chemistry Letters, 19, 3, pp. 2551-2579, (2021); Shao, Jiaming, Low temperature catalytic ozonation of toluene in flue gas over Mn-based catalysts: Effect of support property and SO2/water vapor addition, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 266, (2020); He, Chun, Facet Engineered α-MnO2for Efficient Catalytic Ozonation of Odor CH3SH: Oxygen Vacancy-Induced Active Centers and Catalytic Mechanism, Environmental Science and Technology, 54, 19, pp. 12771-12783, (2020); Ge, Yunli, Performance study of modified Pt catalysts for the complete oxidation of acetone, Chemical Engineering Science, 206, pp. 499-506, (2019); Zhang, Changbin, Perfect catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde over a Pt/TiO2 catalyst at room temperature, Catalysis Communications, 6, 3, pp. 211-214, (2005); Zhang, Changbin, Catalytic performance and mechanism of a Pt/TiO2 catalyst for the oxidation of formaldehyde at room temperature, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 65, 1-2, pp. 37-43, (2006)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20734344","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213235446"

Although many efforts have been made to explore the radical-based catalytic mechanism in traditional HCO processes, they are susceptible to co-existing impurities in natural water. Hence, achieving non-radical and selective oxidation in the catalyst surface region is an important strategy to overcome this bottleneck and attain high chemical utilization efficiency. Despite a handful of studies having been conducted for the non-radical ozonation system, the associated mechanism has not been fully elucidated yet. In this perspective, the surface coordination species in different HCO catalysts are deliberately discussed, including (1) surface-adsorbed H<inf>2</inf>O or surface-OH, (2) surface-adsorbed oxygen species, and (3) surface-organic-O<inf>3</inf> complex.

This work proposes the competitive adsorption combined with bifunctional catalysts as a strategy to avoid malodorous sulfur-containing byproducts. Experimental and theoretical researches demonstrated that ceria incorporated ZSM-5 was a bifunctional material with the coupled, but geometrically separated oxygen site and acid site, while praseodymium-incorporated one was a dual acid site catalyst. A “sites-pathway” relationship for decomposing a mixture of methyl mercaptan (CH<inf>3</inf>SH) and ethyl mercaptan (C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>5</inf>SH) was revealed, i.e., C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>5</inf>SH occupies preferentially on acid site, whereas CH<inf>3</inf>SH is converted into intermediate of CH<inf>3</inf>SCH<inf>3</inf> over acid site, and then CH<inf>3</inf>SCH<inf>3</inf> is forced to occupy on oxygen site, which accelerates the oxidation of CH<inf>3</inf>SCH<inf>3</inf> to CO<inf>2</inf>.

However, in-depth and systematic studies in this area are still lacking. Novel types of amorphous CeMn<inf>x</inf> catalysts with abundant defects were prepared through simple hydrothermal synthesis and used for Cl-VOCs catalysis for the first time. Experimental characterizations and DFT calculations proved that Ce doping induced MnO<inf>2</inf> lattice distortion, which led to the transformation of CeMn<inf>x</inf> into an amorphous structure and the formation of abundant defect sites. It was observed that CeMn<inf>0.16</inf> was able to eliminate chlorobenzene (CB) at 200 °C, and the CO<inf>2</inf> yields and the selectivity of inorganic chlorine was significantly higher than that of MnO<inf>2</inf>. The 18O isotope kinetic experiments revealed that the interfacial reaction process followed the MVK mechanism.

Gas-solid catalytic oxidation methods have been intensively studied for VOC treatment while being greatly hampered by energy consumption, catalyst deactivation, and byproduct formation. Recently, aqueous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have attracted increasing interest for the deep oxidation of VOCs at room temperature, owing to the generation of abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, current reviews mainly focus on VOC degradation performance and have not clarified the specific reaction process, degradation products, and paths of VOCs in different AOPs. This study systematically reviews recent advances in the application of aqueous AOPs for gaseous VOC removal. First, the VOC gas-liquid mass transfer and chemical oxidation processes are presented. Second, the latest research progress of VOC removal by various ROS is reviewed to study their degradation performances, pathways, and mechanisms. Finally, the current challenges and future strategies are discussed from the perspectives of synergistic oxidation of VOC mixtures, accurate oxidation, and resource utilization of target VOCs via aqueous AOPs. This perspective provides the latest information and research inspiration for the future industrial application of aqueous AOPs for VOC waste gas treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Oxidation Processes; Gas−liquid Mass Transfer; Molecular Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compounds; Oxygen; Water; Gases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water; Bioremediation; Effluent Treatment; 'current; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Critical Review; Deep Oxidation; Gas-liquid Mass Transfer; Gaseous Pollutants; Performance; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compound Removals; Volatile Organics; Catalytic Oxidation; Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Volatile Organic Compound; Water; Catalyst; Degradation; Oxidation; Pollutant Removal; Reactive Oxygen Species; Energy Consumption; Gas; Human; Liquid; Review; Room Temperature; Waste Gas Management; Chemistry; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Gases; Oxidation-reduction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water","Bioremediation; Effluent treatment; 'current; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Critical review; Deep oxidation; Gas-liquid mass transfer; Gaseous pollutants; Performance; Reactive oxygen species; Volatile organic compound removals; Volatile organics; Catalytic oxidation; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; volatile organic compound; water; catalyst; degradation; oxidation; pollutant removal; reactive oxygen species; energy consumption; gas; human; liquid; review; room temperature; waste gas management; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; Gases; Oxidation-Reduction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water","","oxygen, 7782-44-7; water, 7732-18-5; Gases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water","This work was financially funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52400146, 22076224, and 22276223), Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province (2023A1515110799), the Research Fund Program of Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Low-carbon Pollution Prevention and Digital Technology/SCNU (NAN\u2019AN) Green and Low-carbon Innovation Center (2024K07), and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (No. CJGJZD20220517142401004).","undefined; Pfannerstill, Eva Y., Comparison between Spatially Resolved Airborne Flux Measurements and Emission Inventories of Volatile Organic Compounds in Los Angeles, Environmental Science and Technology, 57, 41, pp. 15533-15545, (2023); Zhang, Lu, Haze Air Pollution Health Impacts of Breath-Borne VOCs, Environmental Science and Technology, 56, 12, pp. 8541-8551, (2022); Mendelsohn, Robert O., Measuring the impacts of air pollution, Science, 382, 6673, pp. 878-880, (2023); Gałȩzowska, Grażyna, In vitro assays as a tool for determination of VOCs toxic effect on respiratory system: A critical review, TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry, 77, pp. 14-22, (2016); Alvarado, Matthew James, Investigating the links between ozone and organic aerosol chemistry in a biomass burning plume from a prescribed fire in California chaparral, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 15, 12, pp. 6667-6688, (2015); Karlsson, Per Erik, Past, present and future concentrations of ground-level ozone and potential impacts on ecosystems and human health in northern Europe, Science of the Total Environment, 576, pp. 22-35, (2017); Zhang, Yingguang, Photocatalytic Oxidation for Volatile Organic Compounds Elimination: From Fundamental Research to Practical Applications, Environmental Science and Technology, 56, 23, pp. 16582-16601, (2022); Sekimoto, Kanako, Fuel-Type Independent Parameterization of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Western US Wildfires, Environmental Science and Technology, 57, 35, pp. 13193-13204, (2023); Wang, Tao, Sunlight Induces the Production of Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from Thermokarst Ponds, Environmental Science and Technology, 57, 45, pp. 17363-17373, (2023)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","0013936X; 15205851","","ESTHA","39388166","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207150589"

Unlike fully free diffusion in 0–2.0 wt% Pt/CMK-3 and bulk phase diffusion in 10.0 wt% Pt/CMK-3, removal efficiency of 5.0 wt% Pt/CMK-3 was significantly improved to 97.0%, which was attributed to the effective interfacial diffusion of O<inf>3</inf> and CH<inf>3</inf>SH through local microenvironment modulation of Pt0/Pt2+ nanoclusters (NCs) inducing synchronous mass transfer. Experimental and DFT calculations confirmed the strong electronic interactions between O<inf>3</inf> and Pt0 facilitated charge redistribution and preferential O<inf>3</inf> activation. AIMD simulation demonstrated that the synchronous difference in mean-square displacements (MSD) and diffusion coefficient (Dc) of CH<inf>3</inf>SH (Dc=0.022) and O<inf>3</inf> (Dc=0.0046) in the confined Pt/CMK-3 system could facilitate CH<inf>3</inf>SH migrate to Pt2+ through interfacial diffusion.

Bleach, as the major constituent of cleansers, when used improperly or mixed with other indoor cleaning agents, produces harmful halogenated volatile organic compounds. This manuscript assesses the influence of excessive exposure to disinfectants, including bleaching agents, when used against infectious conditions related to SARS-COVID-19 and its management. The use and impact of different bleaching agents in cleansing and their associated problems have been analyzed and presented in this review. This analysis focuses on the conventional and post-pandemic approach towards bleaches. Usage of bleaching agents increased by a staggering 20.4% and 16.4% from January to March 2020 compared to the same period in 2018 and 2019. Mounting use of bleaching agents during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in negative health effects like asthma, eye irritation, and skin allergies. An approximately 42% rise in poisoning cases, including a few deaths, has been associated with exposure to harmful chemicals involving bleaches during the recent pandemic. Bleaching agents are the primary sources of hazardous indoor pollutants; therefore, despite their importance in disinfection, their utility must be substantiated based on legal guidelines, disposal, and remedial measures. Thus, conducting future occupational exposure assessment studies for bleach hazard management is crucial. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bleaches; Disinfection; Hypochlorite; Pandemic; Voc; Asthma; Bleaching; Covid-19; Hazard Management; Occupational Exposure; Skin Disorder; Volatile Organic Compound","asthma; bleaching; COVID-19; hazard management; occupational exposure; skin disorder; volatile organic compound","","","","van Hoof, Gert, Use of product and ingredient tools to assess the environmental profile of automatic dishwashing detergents, Journal of Cleaner Production, 142, pp. 3536-3543, (2017); Koohsaryan, Esmat, Application of zeolites as non-phosphate detergent builders: A review, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 8, 5, (2020); Hashemi, Hassan, Health Consequences of Overexposure to Disinfectants and Self-Medication against SARS-CoV-2: A Cautionary Tale Review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 20, (2022); Soave, Paolo Maurizio, Household disinfectant exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective study of the data from an italian poison control center, European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences, 25, 3, pp. 1738-1742, (2021); Le Roux, Gael, Poisoning during the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown: retrospective analysis of exposures reported to French poison control centres, Clinical Toxicology, 59, 9, pp. 832-839, (2021); Le Roux, Gael, COVID-19: home poisoning throughout the containment period, The Lancet Public Health, 5, 6, (2020); Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, (1992); Sehulster, Lynne M., Healthcare laundry and textiles in the united states: Review and commentary on contemporary infection prevention issues, Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 36, 9, pp. 1073-1088, (2015); Manga, Mohamed S., The impact of raw material properties and process conditions on the color of a powdered formulated detergent product, Particuology, 45, pp. 35-41, (2019); Ziogas, Athanassios, Peroxodicarbonate: Electrosynthesis and first directions to green industrial applications, Current Research in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, 5, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207394853"

The application of gas-phase pulsed corona discharge (PCD) in air–water mixtures provides favorable conditions for the oxidation of VOCs at unsurpassed energy efficiency. This research investigates the impact of water sprinkling on PCD performance in the oxidation of m-xylene as a model compound. Experimental research into the plasma treatment of continuous air flow was undertaken using the PCD reactor in dry and water-sprinkled modes. Water sprinkling more than doubled the m-xylene oxidation rate, which can be attributed to abundant OH-radicals produced at the plasma–water interface. Water sprinkling substantially reduced the formation of nitrous oxide, which is considered to be a secondary pollutant in the outlet air. Ozone is considered a by-product helping the subsequent photocatalytic oxidation of potential residues and photocatalyst maintenance.

Geosmin is an example of a pollutant commonly found in potable water responsible for earthy and musty taste, and odor even at low concentrations. We have investigated the use of a hybrid two-step adsorption-mineralization process for low-level volatile organic compounds removal from potable water using dielectric barrier discharge over common metal oxides (MO). The system proposed is a proof of principle with tert-butanol (TBA) used as a model compound for geosmin removal/degradation during wastewater treatment when combined with an appropriate metal oxide adsorbent. Initial assessments of the adsorption properties of titania by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental tests indicated that the adsorption of geosmin and TBA with water present results in only weak interactions between the sorbate and the metal oxide. In contrast, the DFT results show that alumina could be a suitable adsorbent for these tertiary alcohols and were reinforced by experimental studies. We find that while there is a competitive effect between the water and TBA adsorption from gaseous/liquid feed, the VOC can be removed, and the alumina will be regenerated by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The use of alumina in conjunction with NTP leads to efficient degradation of the adsorbate and the formation of oxygenated intermediates (formates, carbonates, and carboxylate-type species), which could then be mineralized for the regeneration of the adsorbent. A reaction mechanism has been proposed based on the in-situ infrared measurements and DFT calculations, while the removal of TBA with conventional heating is indicative of a gradual desorption process as a function of temperature rather than the destruction of the adsorbate. Furthermore, steady performance was observed after several adsorption-regeneration cycles, indicating no alteration of the adsorption properties of alumina during the NTP treatment and demonstrating the potential of the approach to be applied in the treatment of high throughput of water, without the challenges faced by the biocatalysts or formation of toxic byproducts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Al2o3; Plasma Dbd; Tert-butanol; Water Treatment","","","","Helen Daly and Richard Lewis are acknowledged for very useful discussions at initial stages of the project.

The porous tri-metal oxide catalyst (MCNOx) was derived from the metal organic framework (MOF-74) via an in situ pyrolysis strategy utilizing Mn-doped CoNi-MOF-74 as the precursor. The resulting MCNOx material exhibits a unique series of surface defects, which significantly enhances its catalytic activity. We found that MCNOx materials, due to their high specific surface area, regular porous structure, and excellent reducibility, can synergize well with NTP in the complete decomposition of toluene, which makes the NTP coupled catalytic system have better catalytic activity and CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity. The toluene conversion temperature of T90 in the NTP synergistic thermocatalytic system was 250 °C for the 5MCNOx catalyst, which was also much higher than that of 1MCNOx (256 °C), 10MCNOx (258 °C), CNOx (270 °C), and 5MCNOx catalyst in the monocatalytic system (270 °C). In addition, the catalytic stability of MOF-derived MCNOx oxides and the influence of water vapor on catalytic activity were investigated, confirming their excellent catalytic performance. Finally, the importance of Mn doping in improving toluene oxidation activity on MOF-74 derived CNOx has been demonstrated, providing a viable strategy for developing a toluene oxidation catalyst. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzene; Manganese; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Toluene; Water; Atomic Emission Spectroscopy; Bioremediation; Catalytic Oxidation; Layered Semiconductors; Liquid Crystals; Manganese; Manganese Compounds; Manganese Metallurgy; Metamorphic Rocks; Photodegradation; Semiconductor Doping; Toluene; Catalytic Performance; High Specific Surface Area; Lows-temperatures; Metal Oxides Catalysts; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Mn-doped; Nonthermal Plasma; Photocatalytic Process; Toluene Oxidation; ]+ Catalyst; Pyrolysis; Benzene; Manganese; Metal Organic Framework; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Water; Adsorption; Article; Catalyst; Combustion; Conductance; Controlled Study; Decomposition; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Gas Chromatography; Low Temperature; Oxidation; Photocatalysis; Pore Size Distribution; Pyrolysis; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Water Vapor; X Ray Diffraction","Atomic emission spectroscopy; Bioremediation; Catalytic oxidation; Layered semiconductors; Liquid crystals; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Manganese metallurgy; Metamorphic rocks; Photodegradation; Semiconductor doping; Toluene; Catalytic performance; High specific surface area; Lows-temperatures; Metal oxides catalysts; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Mn-doped; Nonthermal plasma; Photocatalytic process; Toluene oxidation; ]+ catalyst; Pyrolysis; benzene; manganese; metal organic framework; nitrogen; oxygen; toluene; volatile organic compound; water; adsorption; Article; catalyst; combustion; conductance; controlled study; decomposition; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gas chromatography; low temperature; oxidation; photocatalysis; pore size distribution; pyrolysis; scanning electron microscopy; water vapor; X ray diffraction","","benzene, 71-43-2; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; oxygen, 7782-44-7; toluene, 108-88-3; water, 7732-18-5","The project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of the China (No. 5226100088).","Huang, Huang, Remarkable promotion effect of lauric acid on Mn-MIL-100 for non-thermal plasma-catalytic decomposition of toluene, Applied Surface Science, 503, (2020); Saoud, Wala Abdou, Synergism between non-thermal plasma and photocatalysis: Implicationsin the post discharge of ozone at a pilot scale in a catalytic fixed-bed reactor, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 241, pp. 227-235, (2019); Yu, Xin, A comparison of in- and post-plasma catalysis for toluene abatement through continuous and sequential processes in dielectric barrier discharge reactors, Journal of Cleaner Production, 276, (2020); Veerapandian, Savita K.P., Abatement of VOCs using packed bed non-thermal plasma reactors: A review, Catalysts, 7, 4, (2017); Chen, Changwei, Microwave-Assisted Rapid Synthesis of Well-Shaped MOF-74 (Ni) for CO 2 Efficient Capture, Inorganic Chemistry, 58, 4, pp. 2717-2728, (2019); Jian, Yanfei, In-Depth Understanding of the Morphology Effect of α-Fe 2 O 3 on Catalytic Ethane Destruction, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 11, 12, pp. 11369-11383, (2019); Feng, Xiangbo, Non-thermal plasma coupled with MOF-74 derived Mn-Co-Ni-O porous composite oxide for toluene efficient degradation, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 383, (2020); Mao, Lutao, Regulating asymmetric oxygen vacancies in copper-ceria catalysts for achievement of excellent toluene catalytic oxidation, Separation and Purification Technology, 334, (2024); Zheng, Yanfei, Catalytic oxidation of VOCs and CO on cobalt-based Materials: Strategies and mechanisms for improving activity and stability, Chemical Engineering Journal, 484, (2024); Li, Yifei, Engineering Cobalt Oxide with Coexisting Cobalt Defects and Oxygen Vacancies for Enhanced Catalytic Oxidation of Toluene, ACS Catalysis, 12, 9, pp. 4906-4917, (2022)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","13699261; 11440546","","NJCHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204357688"

Catalytic oxidation can be a promising technology for VOC purification owing to its high efficiency and energy-saving advantages. Over the past few decades, the development of catalysts with excellent activity and lower degradation temperature for VOCs has been the main purpose of research. The research goal is gradually refined and changed as research deepens. In consideration of different types of pollutants and their actual sources, the challenges in catalyst design become more specific and practical, such as the improvement of catalyst stability, the inhibition of the generation of harmful by-products and the enhancement of resistance to impurity poisoning. Meanwhile, it is necessary to develop catalysts for simultaneous control of multiple pollutants. Concurrently, some new technologies have become research hotspots, including hydrolysis oxidation technology for CVOCs and ozone oxidation technology for VOCs. In this review, the latest advancements in the catalytic degradation of various VOCs are discussed and insights into future research directions for novel materials and technologies in VOC catalytic oxidation are further provided. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Cleaners; Air Quality; Energy Efficiency; Atmospheric Quality; Catalytic Purification; Efficiency Savings; Emission Of Volatile Organic Compounds; Energy-savings; Higher Efficiency; Industrialisation; Oxidation Technology; Volatile Organics; ]+ Catalyst; Catalytic Oxidation; Catalysis; Catalyst; Hydrolysis; Oxidation; Pollutant Source; Purification; Volatile Organic Compound","Air cleaners; Air quality; Energy efficiency; Atmospheric quality; Catalytic purification; Efficiency savings; Emission of volatile organic compounds; Energy-savings; Higher efficiency; Industrialisation; Oxidation technology; Volatile organics; ]+ catalyst; Catalytic oxidation; catalysis; catalyst; hydrolysis; oxidation; pollutant source; purification; volatile organic compound","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22476157, 22276145).","Zhou, Hualong, Progress of catalytic oxidation of VOCs by manganese-based catalysts, Fuel, 366, (2024); He, Chi, Recent Advances in the Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds: A Review Based on Pollutant Sorts and Sources, Chemical Reviews, 119, 7, pp. 4471-4568, (2019); Lou, Benzhen, Catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds by non-noble metal catalyst: Current advancement and future prospectives, Journal of Cleaner Production, 363, (2022); Yang, Cuiting, Abatement of various types of VOCs by adsorption/catalytic oxidation: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 370, pp. 1128-1153, (2019); Guo, Yunlong, Recent advances in VOC elimination by catalytic oxidation technology onto various nanoparticles catalysts: a critical review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 281, (2021); Choi, Byung-seok, Simulation and optimization on the regenerative thermal oxidation of volatile organic compounds, Chemical Engineering Journal, 76, 2, pp. 103-114, (2000); Mudliar, Sandeep N., Bioreactors for treatment of VOCs and odours - A review, Journal of Environmental Management, 91, 5, pp. 1039-1054, (2010); Almaie, Soudeh, Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) removal by photocatalysts: A review, Chemosphere, 306, (2022); Huang, Haibao, Low temperature catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds: A review, Catalysis Science and Technology, 5, 5, pp. 2649-2669, (2015); Hu, Changxing, Minireview and Perspective of One-Dimensional Manganese Oxide Nanostructures for the Removal of Air Pollutants, Energy and Fuels, 37, 15, pp. 10886-10896, (2023)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20518161; 20518153","","","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203009790"

Synergistic catalytic degradation has sparked significant interest in multipollutant control, especially for industries with limited space for technological upgrades to satisfy more stringent emission regulations. However, it is still in the early stages of development and faces many issues and challenges, such as highly efficient catalyst design, uncertain reaction mechanism for multipollutant removal, impact of other components in complex flue gas on the synergistic catalytic degradation, and environmental risk assessment of synergistic catalytic degradation in terms of byproduct. This review summarizes the advantage and disadvantage of common reported catalysts for synergistic catalytic degradation, discusses the factors affecting the performance and the optimization technique from the standpoint of acidity and redox characteristics, refines the synergistic catalytic degradation mechanism and deactivation process due to the presence of toxic component, and highlights the category and formation mechanism of the potential byproduct during the synergistic catalytic degradation.

However, the thermal effect generated during the discharge process leads to energy waste and low energy utilization efficiency. In this work, an innovative DBD thermally-conducted catalysis (DBD-TCC) system, integrating high-frequency AC-DBD plasma and its generated thermal effects to activate the Co/SBA-15 catalyst, was employed for toluene removal. Specifically, Co/SBA-15 catalysts are closely positioned to the ground electrode of the plasma zone and can be heated and activated by the thermal effect when the voltage exceeds 10 kV. At 12.4 kV, the temperature in the catalyst zone reached 261 °C in the DBD-TCC system, resulting in an increase in toluene degradation efficiency of 17%, CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity of 21.2%, and energy efficiency of 27%, respectively, compared to the DBD system alone. In contrast, the DBD thermally-unconducted catalysis (DBD-TUC) system fails to enhance toluene degradation due to insufficient heat absorption and catalytic activation, highlighting the crucial role of AC-DBD generated heat in the activation of the catalyst. Furthermore, the degradation pathway and mechanism of toluene in the DBD-TCC system were hypothesized.

This review first aims to outline landfills, waste disposal and valorization, conventional gas treatment techniques commonly employed for LFG treatment, such as flares and thermal oxidation. Furthermore, it explores biotechnological approaches as more technically and economically feasible alternatives for mitigating LFG emissions, especially in the case of small and aged landfills where CH<inf>4</inf> concentrations are often below 3% v/v.

Improper treatment of petrochemical waste gas (PWG) seriously harms human health and the natural environment. This study uses CiteSpace and VOSviewer to conduct a scientometric analysis of 1384 scholarly works on PWG and carbon sequestration published between 1981 and 2022, revealing the basic characteristics, knowledge base, research topic evolution, and research hotspots of the field. The results show the following: (1) In the early stages of the petrochemical industry, it was processed tail gas, plant leakage waste gas, and combustion flue gas that were investigated in PWG research. (2) Later, green environmental protection technology was widely studied in the field of PWG treatment, such as biotechnology, catalytic oxidation technology, membrane separation technology, etc., in order to achieve efficient, low energy consumption and low emissions of waste gas treatment, and the number of publications related to this topic has increased rapidly. In addition, researchers studied the internet of things and technology integration, such as the introduction of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and other technologies, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of exhaust gas monitoring, control, and management. (3) The department has focused on how to reduce emissions by optimizing petrochemical process lines or improving energy efficiency. Emission reduction and low-carbon transition in the petrochemical industry will become the main trend in the future. Switching from renewable carbon to feedstock carbon derived from captured carbon dioxide, biomass, or recycled chemicals has become an attractive strategy to help curb emissions from the chemical industry. The results of our analysis can provide funding agencies and research groups with information to better understand the global trends and directions that have emerged in this field from 1981 to 2022 and serve as a reference for future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bibliometric Analysis; Carbon Emissions; Exhaust Emission; Petrochemical Industry; Vocs; Carbon Emission; Carbon Sequestration; Chemical Industry; Environmental Protection; Greenhouse Effect; Oxidation; Petrochemical Industry; Separation; Volatile Organic Compound","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; chemical industry; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; oxidation; petrochemical industry; separation; volatile organic compound","","","This work has received support from various sources, including the Jiangxi Province \u201CDouble Thousand Plan\u201D Innovation Leading Talent Long Term Project (S2021CQKJ0696), Key R&D projects in Jiangxi Province (20223BBF61019), Higher Education Reform Research Project of Jiangxi Province (JXJG-22-1-17), the First Class Undergraduate Course Construction Project, and the Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Nanchang University (202210403102 and S202210403083).","Geng, Zhiqiang, Energy optimization and prediction modeling of petrochemical industries: An improved convolutional neural network based on cross-feature, Energy, 194, (2020); Jafarinejad, Shahryar, Current technologies and future directions for treating petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants (PRPP) wastewaters, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 7, 5, (2019); Fagerlund, Johan, Performance of an amine-based CO2 capture pilot plant at the Klemetsrud waste incinerator in Oslo, Norway, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 106, (2021); Liu, Yurong, Process modelling, optimisation and analysis of heat recovery energy system for petrochemical industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 381, (2022); Zhou, Xin, One-step leap in achieving oil-to-chemicals by using a two-stage riser reactor: Molecular-level process model and multi-objective optimization strategy, Chemical Engineering Journal, 444, (2022); Chin J Dis Control Prev, (2017); Sarkar, Chinmoy, Unexplored volatile organic compound emitted from petrochemical facilities: Implications for ozone production and atmospheric chemistry, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 21, 15, pp. 11505-11518, (2021); Santosa, Daniel Miki, Coprocessing Biomass Fast Pyrolysis and Catalytic Fast Pyrolysis Oils with Vacuum Gas Oil in Refinery Hydroprocessing, Energy and Fuels, 36, 20, pp. 12641-12650, (2022); Naraki, Hamideh, Urban street dust in the Middle East oldest oil refinery zone: Oxidative potential, source apportionment، and health risk assessment of potentially toxic elements, Chemosphere, 268, (2021); Zhang, Ziyue, Impacts of Pollutant Emissions from Typical Petrochemical Enterprises on Air Quality in the North China Plain, Atmosphere, 14, 3, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199930046"

Here, a facile surface molten salt-assisted approach for fabricating porous iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts enriched with catalytically accessible single-atom motifs is reported. Multiple characterization analyses prove that abundant intrinsic defects are generated at the edge sites, resulting in the formation of thermally stable unstitched Fe-N<inf>3</inf> motif. Theoretical investigations unveil that the transition from Fe-N<inf>4</inf> to Fe-N<inf>3</inf> induces structural alteration, resulting in the convergence of Fe-3d orbital energy to Fermi energy. The low-coordinated Fe-N<inf>3</inf> motif exhibits higher activation ability, reinforcing its interaction with O<inf>3</inf> and weakening the O-O bond. This leads to a reduction in the reactivity of surface atomic oxygen barriers (O<inf>3</inf>-to-*O/*OO), ultimately achieving efficient catalytic oxidation of methyl mercaptan and its intermediates, achieving performance 20-fold higher than intact Fe-N<inf>4</inf> catalysts and 625-fold higher than commercial MnO<inf>2</inf>.

They pose a risk to human health and ecosystems, even at low concentrations. Controlling VOCs is crucial for good air quality. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various methods used for controlling VOC abatement. The advancement of mono-functional treatment techniques, including recovery such as absorption, adsorption, condensation, and membrane separation, and destruction-based methods such as natural degradation methods, advanced oxidation processes, and reduction methods were discussed. Among these methods, advanced oxidation processes are considered the most effective for removing toxic VOCs, despite some drawbacks such as costly chemicals, rigorous reaction conditions, and the formation of secondary chemicals. Standalone technologies are generally not sufficient and do not perform satisfactorily for the removal of hazardous air pollutants due to the generation of innocuous end products. However, every integration technique complements superiority and overcomes the challenges of standalone technologies. For instance, by using catalytic oxidation, catalytic ozonation, non-thermal plasma, and photocatalysis pretreatments, the amount of bioaerosols released from the bioreactor can be significantly reduced, leading to effective conversion rates for non-polar compounds, and opening new perspectives towards promising techniques with countless benefits. Interestingly, the three-stage processes have shown efficient decomposition performance for polar VOCs, excellent recoverability for nonpolar VOCs, and promising potential applications in atmospheric purification. Furthermore, the review also reports on the evolution of mathematical and artificial neural network modeling for VOC removal performance. The article critically analyzes the synergistic effects and advantages of integration. The authors hope that this article will be helpful in deciding on the appropriate strategy for controlling interested VOCs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioreactor; Destruction Methods; Integration; Recovery Methods; Synergistic Effects; Volatile Organic Compounds; Nitrogen; Sulfur; Air Pollutants; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Quality; Catalytic Oxidation; Health Risks; Integration; Neural Networks; Ozone; Ozonization; Quality Control; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption Separation; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Destruction Method; Industrial Processs; Low Concentrations; Recovery Methods; Risk To Human Health; Synergistic Effect; Technology Integration; Treatment Techniques; Bioreactors; Aliphatic Hydrocarbon; Aromatic Hydrocarbon; Halogenated Hydrocarbon; Nitrogen; Sulfur; Volatile Organic Compound; Artificial Neural Network; Bioreactor; Decomposition; Degradation; Membrane; Oxidation; Reduction; Absorption; Adsorption; Aerosol; Air Pollutant; Air Quality; Atmosphere; Biodegradation; Biotechnology; Chemical Procedures; Chemical Reaction; Cost Control; Destruction; Gas Waste; Human; Mathematical Model; Membrane Separation; Oxidation Kinetics; Ozonation; Phase Separation; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Phytoremediation; Plasma Gas; Review; Synergistic Effect; Waste Management; Air Pollution; Chemistry; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Prevention And Control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Oxidation-reduction; Volatile Organic Compounds","Air quality; Catalytic oxidation; Health risks; Integration; Neural networks; Ozone; Ozonization; Quality control; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption separation; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Destruction method; Industrial processs; Low concentrations; Recovery methods; Risk to human health; Synergistic effect; Technology Integration; Treatment techniques; Bioreactors; aliphatic hydrocarbon; aromatic hydrocarbon; halogenated hydrocarbon; nitrogen; sulfur; volatile organic compound; artificial neural network; bioreactor; decomposition; degradation; membrane; oxidation; reduction; absorption; adsorption; aerosol; air pollutant; air quality; atmosphere; biodegradation; biotechnology; chemical procedures; chemical reaction; cost control; destruction; gas waste; human; mathematical model; membrane separation; oxidation kinetics; ozonation; phase separation; photocatalysis; photolysis; phytoremediation; plasma gas; Review; synergistic effect; waste management; air pollution; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Oxidation-Reduction; Volatile Organic Compounds","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9; Air Pollutants; Volatile Organic Compounds","Funding text 1: Inorganic filler and organic polymer combined and synthesised to MMM which has good separation and permeability performance (Drobek et al., 2015). Many separation studies have been conducted by authors Sedláková et al. (2014), Banihashemi et al. (2018) and Fang et al. (2015) using MMM with carbon nano tubes/activated carbon fiber/metal organic frameworks for the removal of hexane, ethanol, toluene, propane, p-xylene and o-xylene. n-Hexane and toluene has higher permeability than ethanol while p-xylene has higher permeability than o-xylene. Unlike MMM, CM generally prepared by covering a porous support (PVDF, polysulfone, polypropylene and polyetherimide) with the help of dense of organic polymer (PDMS and PEBA) (Liao et al., 2018). Anyhow, interface improvement between the porous and polymer layer is still challenging. Membrane separation processes are currently being used for the recovery of VOCs. However, their industrial application remains challenging due to issues such as membrane fouling, regeneration, permeability, selectivity trade-offs, physical aging, and plasticization. It should be noted that these recovery methods only transfer the VOCs from one phase to another without degrading them into eco-friendly substances. As a result, secondary treatment is still required. Therefore, destruction methods have become more popular in the last few decades.Comparatively, biodegradation (BIO) process has been recommended for VOCs removal because of efficient conversion of pollutants into innocuous end-products, relatively cheap, eco-friendly, and reliable process (Baskaran et al., 2019; Rajamanickam et al., 2020). Bioreactors found to be promising technology for various type of VOCs (less than 3 g m−3) and VOCs mixture using biofilter (BT), biotrickling filter (BTF), bioscrubber (BS), hollow fiber membrane bioreactor (MB), rotating biological contractor (RBC), air diffusion bioreactor (ALR), and two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB). Bioreactors can be designed to handle a VOC concentration: <10 g m-3, inlet loading rate (ILR): >5000 m3 h−1, empty bed residence time (EBRT): >20 s and pressure drop: 0.4–4 cm H2O and achieved elimination capacity (EC): 21 g m−3 h−1 when inlet loading rate of 35 g m−3 h−1 and removal efficiency: 85–95% (Yoshikawa et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2023). The advantages, limitations and remarkable actions for the bioreactors are presented in Table S2. The main difference between the bioreactors is based on the amount of flow of water inside (stagnant for BT, continuously moving for BTF and BS), phase state of the biomass (immobilized or suspended) and supported media on test bed. We have reviewed and detailed the comparison of biodegradation techniques including BT, BTF and BS for the removal of available VOCs earlier (Malakar et al., 2017). Microorganisms can grow on the surface of porous support material as a biofilm where it can uptake the VOCs and produced CO2, H2O, organic biomass, and sometimes intermediate by-products. The selected microorganisms (aerobic, an-aerobic, and facultative bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa, etc.) used under local dryness condition and maintained a good level of activity and some of the reported microorganisms are showed in Table S2.The performance of the biofilter and biotrickling filter is highly dependent on the type of packing materials used such as organic, natural inorganic and synthetic materials. Many green packing materials and their compositions were tested in the biofilter for VOC treatment, such as scoria-bagasse, peat, coconut fiber and shell, bamboo, sugar beet pulp, poplar tree skin, wood bark, rice, maize, cane residues, pine leaves, cow dung compost, cattle bone porcelite, composite ceramic, horticultural perlite, pelletized diatomaceous earth biological support media, peat mixed with heather, sludge-based compost, and compost over a clay pellet. Overall, the use of green carriers in different BF and BTF showed the highest performance in terms of pollutants elimination capacity and economic viability. There are various typical operating conditions affecting the biodegradation efficiency in bioreactor including VOC concentration, empty bed residence time, gas flow rate, velocity of air, bed depth, bed porosity, moisture content, pressure drop, oxygen content, bed surface area, liquid holdup, type of packing material, temperature, pH and acclimation time of microbes (Baskaran et al., 2019).The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Hun-Soo Byun reports financial support was provided by National Research Foundation of Korea.

In this context, electronegative fluorinated-gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF<inf>6</inf>) and hydrofluorocarbon, have become important emission reduction objects due to their strong global warming potential. In this work, the MnOx@Mn/SiC heterojunction was rationally designed and prepared. Because of the high electron coupling, the positively charged active-site MnOx@Mn (δ+) not only promotes the adsorption of SF<inf>6</inf> but also acts as a donor to transport electrons to SF<inf>6</inf>, so that the adsorption and activation of SF<inf>6</inf> are unified in one active site. Therefore, MnOx@Mn/SiC can effectively degrade SF<inf>6</inf> above 450°C, and the degradation amount for 12 vol% SF<inf>6</inf> can reach 523.8 mL g−1 at 600°C. Furthermore, it also has good degradation performance on hydrofluorocarbons (R-22 and R-410A) even at 100°C. Given the cheap and easy scale-up synthesis, MnOx@Mn/SiC has the potential to reduce the emission of multiple fluorinated-gases in practical applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electron Donor; Electronegative F-gases; Greenhouse Gas Fixation; Heterojunction; Sulfur Hexafluoride (sf6)","","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 22171180 ), Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality ( 20520741400 and 20520710400 ) and Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project .

The mineralization efficiency, degradation pathway and mechanism, and effects of the process operating parameters were investigated in detail using toluene as the target pollutant. The results show that the average removal efficiency of toluene reached 71.82 % within 90 min under optimal conditions (C<inf>Toluene</inf> = 100 mg/m3; C<inf>O3</inf> = 1 mg/L; catalyst loading = 5 g/L; pH = 7; gas flow = 500 mL/min), which outperformed that of the gaseous system. Quenching experiments and electron spin resonance spectroscopy indicate that [rad]OH and [rad]O<inf>2</inf>− are the two main reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in the system, which facilitate the opening of the benzene ring and significantly reduce by-products. The intermediates of toluene degradation were identified by proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (PTR-TOF-MS). The results indicate that most of the intermediates generated in the system are captured in water rather than being emitted into the atmosphere. In the pilot-scale experiments, the WCO process exhibited a stable VOC removal efficiency (≥61.05 %) for 10 d in the treatment of actual low-concentration VOCs. Therefore, in this study, an effective process for the removal of low-concentration VOCs is proposed, which can be used for multiple VOC treatments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activated Carbon (ac); Manganese Oxide; Pilot Scale; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Wet Scrubbing Coupled Catalytic Ozonation (wco); Activated Carbon; Biodegradation; Catalysts; Efficiency; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Flow Of Gases; Magnetic Moments; Manganese Oxide; Mass Spectrometry; Ozone; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Proton Transfer; Reaction Intermediates; Toluene; Catalytic Ozonation; Ozonation Process; Pilot Scale; Removal Efficiencies; Volatile Organic Compound; Wet Scrubbing; Wet Scrubbing Coupled Catalytic Ozonation (wet Scrubbing – Catalytic Ozonation); Volatile Organic Compounds","Activated carbon; Biodegradation; Catalysts; Efficiency; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Flow of gases; Magnetic moments; Manganese oxide; Mass spectrometry; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Proton transfer; Reaction intermediates; Toluene; Catalytic ozonation; Ozonation process; Pilot scale; Removal efficiencies; Volatile organic compound; Wet scrubbing; Wet scrubbing coupled catalytic ozonation (wet scrubbing – catalytic ozonation); Volatile organic compounds","","","This work was supported by the Beijing Science and Technology Planning Project, China (No. Z201100008220012 ), and the program of the Innovation Engineering Project of Beijing Academy of Science and Technology, China (No. 11000023T000002129940 ).","Amanollahi, Hawzhin, Enhanced vacuum UV-based process (VUV/H2O2/PMS) for the effective removal of ammonia from water: Engineering configuration and mechanistic considerations, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 402, (2021); Asenjo, Natalia G., High performance activated carbon for benzene/toluene adsorption from industrial wastewater, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 192, 3, pp. 1525-1532, (2011); Biard, Pierre François, Intensification of volatile organic compounds mass transfer in a compact scrubber using the O3/H2O2 advanced oxidation process: Kinetic study and hydroxyl radical tracking, Chemosphere, 85, 7, pp. 1122-1129, (2011); Biard, Pierre François, Assessment and optimisation of VOC mass transfer enhancement by advanced oxidation process in a compact wet scrubber, Chemosphere, 77, 2, pp. 182-187, (2009); Chen, Haiying, A comprehensive mathematical model for analyzing synergistic effect of oxidation and mass transfer enhancement during UV-Fenton removal of VOCs, Chemosphere, 283, (2021); Cheng, Zhuowei, Thermally activated persulfate for gaseous p-xylene removal: Process optimization, mechanism investigation, and pathway analysis, Chemical Engineering Journal, 421, (2021); Dai, Wenjing, Exceptional Ozone Decomposition over δ-MnO2/AC under an Entire Humidity Environment, Environmental Science and Technology, 57, 46, pp. 17727-17736, (2023); Dong, Yongli, Construction of surface oxygen vacancy active sites upon MnOx/AC composite catalysts for efficient coupling adsorption and oxidation of toluene, Chemical Engineering Journal, 464, (2023); Fu, Chenchong, Adsorption-enforced Fenton-like process using activated carbon-supported iron oxychloride catalyst for wet scrubbing of airborne dichloroethane, Chemosphere, 307, (2022); He, Chi, Recent Advances in the Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds: A Review Based on Pollutant Sorts and Sources, Chemical Reviews, 119, 7, pp. 4471-4568, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18733794; 13835866","","SPUTF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181761540"

They can cause problems both for humans and the environment. This work aimed to examine the non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology combined with a heterogeneous catalyst (“in plasma catalysis”, IPC) for the removal of toluene from the air at an applied voltage lower than that commonly reported in the literature. The NTP system was studied in the absence and presence of two commercial catalysts (γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> spheres and TiO<inf>2</inf> pellets) investigating the influence of the operating conditions (inlet flow rate, inlet pollutant concentration, water vapor presence and applied voltage). The results demonstrated that NTP without catalyst can remove toluene at voltages not less than 13.20 kV. On the other hand, the use γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> in IPC configuration allowed to achieve better performance than TiO<inf>2</inf> with the lowest applied voltage (10.67 kV) for plasma generation. Specifically, with an air flow rate of 15 NL/h at 8.7% of relative humidity and containing 500 ppm of toluene, a pollutant conversion of about 89% and a CO<inf>2</inf>/CO molar ratio equal to 4.72 was achieved. Moreover, contrary to what was observed in the NTP system without catalyst, the presence of both γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and TiO<inf>2</inf> in the IPC configuration allowed to avoid the presence of O<inf>3</inf> and NO<inf>x</inf> at the reactor outlet.

In the first 2 years of the pandemic, it was frequently reported, although its incidence has significantly decreased with the emergence of the Omicron variant, which has since become the dominant viral strain. Nevertheless, many patients continue to suffer from persistent dysosmia and dysgeusia, making COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction an ongoing health concern. The proposed pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated olfactory dysfunction are complex and likely multifactorial. While evidence suggests that infection of sustentacular cells and associated mucosal inflammation may be the culprit of acute, transient smell loss, alterations in other components of the olfactory system (e.g., olfactory receptor neuron dysfunction, olfactory bulb injury and alterations in the olfactory cortex) may lead to persistent, long-term olfactory dysfunction.

We investigated these possible effects using a plant-pollinator interaction where the VOCs responsible for pollinator attraction are known and which is commonly exposed to high O<inf>3</inf> concentration episodes: the Mediterranean fig tree (Ficus carica) and its unique pollinator, the fig wasp (Blastophaga psenes). In controlled conditions, we exposed fig trees bearing receptive figs to a high-O<inf>3</inf> episode (5 h) of 200 ppb and analyzed VOC emission. In addition, we investigated the chemical reactions occurring in the atmosphere between O<inf>3</inf> and pollinator-attractive VOCs using real-time monitoring. Finally, we tested the response of fig wasps to the chemical signal when exposed to increasing O<inf>3</inf> mixing ratios (0, 40, 80, 120 and 200 ppb). The exposure of the fig tree to high O<inf>3</inf> levels induced a significant decrease in leaf stomatal conductance, a limited change in the emission by receptive figs of VOCs not involved in pollinator attraction, but a major change in the relative abundances of the compounds among pollinator-attractive VOCs in O<inf>3</inf>-enriched atmosphere. Fig VOCs reacted with O<inf>3</inf> in the atmosphere even at the lowest level tested (40 ppb) and the resulting changes in VOC composition significantly disrupted the attraction of the specific pollinator. These results strongly suggest that current O<inf>3</inf> episodes are probably already affecting the interaction between the fig tree and its specific pollinator. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Ficus Carica; Flowers; Mediterranean Ecosystems; Plant-pollinator Interaction; Vocs; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Ozone; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds; Ap4-porometer; Commercial Software Tofware V2.4.5; Ptr-tof-ms 8000; R V. 3.6.2; Air Pollution; Ozone; Chemical Signals; Controlled Conditions; Emission Of Volatile Organic Compounds; Exposed To; Ficus Carica; Flower; High Reactivity; Mediterranean Ecosystem; Plant-pollinator Interaction; Tropospheric Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Volatile Organic Compound; Ozone; Atmospheric Pollution; Chemical Reaction; Concentration (composition); Ecosystem; Mixing Ratio; Plant-insect Interaction; Pollination; Pollinator; Stomatal Conductance; Tree; Air Pollution; Article; Atmosphere; Bioassay; Fig; Insect Pollination; Mass Fragmentography; Nonhuman; Ozonolysis; Photolysis; Plant; Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry; Southern Europe; Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry; Animal; Ficus; Physiology; Wasp; Animals; Pollination; Trees; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wasps","Air pollution; Ozone; Chemical signals; Controlled conditions; Emission of volatile organic compounds; Exposed to; Ficus carica; Flower; High reactivity; Mediterranean ecosystem; Plant-pollinator interaction; Tropospheric ozone; Volatile organic compounds; polytetrafluoroethylene; volatile organic compound; ozone; atmospheric pollution; chemical reaction; concentration (composition); ecosystem; mixing ratio; plant-insect interaction; pollination; pollinator; stomatal conductance; tree; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; bioassay; fig; insect pollination; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; ozonolysis; photolysis; plant; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; Southern Europe; time of flight mass spectrometry; animal; Ficus; physiology; wasp; Animals; Pollination; Trees; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wasps","","polytetrafluoroethylene, 9002-84-0; ozone, 10028-15-6; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds","This work was funded by “ Montpellier Université d'Excellence ” (MUSE, ANR under the “Investissements d'avenir” program, reference ANR-16-IDEX-0006 ), International Research Project (IRP)-CNRS-MOST, the French National Research Program for Environmental and Occupational Health of ANSES (reference 2018/1/138) and the Observatoire de la REcherche Méditerranéen de l'Environnement (SO PolliMed, OSU OREME).","Agathokleous, Evgenios, Ozone pollution disrupts plant–pollinator systems, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 37, 11, pp. 939-941, (2022); Atkinson, Roger, Gas-phase tropospheric chemistry of biogenic volatile organic compounds: A review, Atmospheric Environment, 37, SUPPL. 2, pp. 197-219, (2003); J R Stat Soc B, (1995); Bernard, François, Studies of the gas phase reactions of linalool, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol and 3-methyl-1-penten-3-ol with O 3 and OH radicals, Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 116, 24, pp. 6113-6126, (2012); Bernard, François, Atmospheric chemistry of benzyl alcohol: Kinetics and mechanism of reaction with OH radicals, Environmental Science and Technology, 47, 7, pp. 3182-3189, (2013); Black, Valerie J., Ozone affects gas exchange, growth and reproductive development in Brassica campestris (Wisconsin Fast Plants), New Phytologist, 176, 1, pp. 150-163, (2007); Blande, James D., Plant volatiles in polluted atmospheres: Stress responses and signal degradation, Plant, Cell and Environment, 37, 8, pp. 1892-1904, (2014); Brosset, Agnès, Volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions: volatile organic compounds as modulators of receiver plant defence, growth, and reproduction, Journal of Experimental Botany, 73, 2, pp. 511-528, (2022); Calogirou, Aggelos, Gas-phase terpene oxidation products: A review, Atmospheric Environment, 33, 9, pp. 1423-1439, (1999); Cappellin, Luca, On quantitative determination of volatile organic compound concentrations using proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Environmental Science and Technology, 46, 4, pp. 2283-2290, (2012)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","38354792","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185449027"

In this study, a monolithic catalyst was successfully developed by loading Pt-CeO<inf>2</inf> onto nickel foam (NF) matrix through hydrothermal and reduction methods. The photothermal catalytic performance was investigated at room temperature for varying Pt content, toluene concentration, light source type, and water content. Remarkably, the toluene removal efficiency and CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity stabilized at 98.8 % and 74.6 %, respectively, within less than 10 min of light activation. The d-d transition thermal effect of CeO<inf>2</inf> and plasma effect of Pt enhanced light-to-heat conversion and active free radical generation (•O<inf>2</inf>– and •OH) through light absorption, respectively. The NF matrix's excellent thermal conductivity ensured a rapid increase in catalyst temperature upon visible light irradiation, reaching 173 °C. The study demonstrated that both the Mars-van Krevelen (Mvk) oxidation process, driven by temperature increase from near-infrared (NIR) absorption, and the free radical oxidation process, induced by higher energy illumination, synergistically contributed to toluene decomposition and mineralization.

In this work, we used low-cost biomass to develop nanocomposites of N-doped carbon-supported zinc oxide (ZNC400) at a low temperature (400 °C), which exhibited ultrahigh activity in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) for organic water decontamination. Our experimental and computational studies revealed the collaborative functions of dual active centers of defective carbons and oxygen vacancies (OVs)-containing zinc oxide (ZnO) at the composite interface for successive ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) adsorption and catalytic decomposition, respectively. Inspiringly, OVs on ZnO will spontaneously dissociate water molecules (H<inf>2</inf>O) to form surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) as key intermediates to accelerate O<inf>3</inf> decomposition. This synergistic interplay results in the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and maintains over 90.2% atrazine (ATZ) removal over five successive cycles, endowing ZNC400 with substantial reusability. Furthermore, four ATZ degradation pathways were proposed, and the corresponding toxicity was evaluated by the embryonic development of zebrafish in the treated water. Overall, the engineered dual-function catalyst effectively addresses the long-standing issue of poor stability of carbon materials in HCO and offers high-performance, cheap, and green catalysts for advanced water purification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Defective Carbon; Dissociated Hydroxyl Group; Dual Active Sites; Oxygen Vacancy; Toxicity Alteration; Catalyst Activity; Costs; Doping (additives); Ii-vi Semiconductors; Molecules; Oxygen Vacancies; Ozone; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Redox Reactions; Reusability; Temperature; Zinc Oxide; Active Site; Catalytic Ozonation; Defective Carbon; Dissociated Hydroxyl Group; Dual Active Site; Heterogeneous Catalytic Ozonation; Hydroxyl Groups; Low-costs; Toxicity Alteration; Water Decontamination; Toxicity","Catalyst activity; Costs; Doping (additives); II-VI semiconductors; Molecules; Oxygen vacancies; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Redox reactions; Reusability; Temperature; Zinc oxide; Active site; Catalytic ozonation; Defective carbon; Dissociated hydroxyl group; Dual active site; Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation; Hydroxyl groups; Low-costs; Toxicity alteration; Water decontamination; Toxicity","","","This work was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFD3203701-03), the Heilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program (Grant No. HIT-SE-01), and the State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology (No. 2022TS04).","Yang, Wenwen, Plasmon-enhanced Catalytic Ozonation for Efficient Removal of Recalcitrant Water Pollutants, ACS ES and T Engineering, 1, 5, pp. 874-883, (2021); Wang, Jing, Manipulating Selectivity of Hydroxyl Radical Generation by Single-Atom Catalysts in Catalytic Ozonation: Surface or Solution, Environmental Science and Technology, 56, 24, pp. 17753-17762, (2022); Yang, Li, Catalytic ozonation of selected pharmaceuticals over mesoporous alumina-supported manganese oxide, Environmental Science and Technology, 43, 7, pp. 2525-2529, (2009); Wei, Kajia, Ni-Induced C-Al2O3-Framework (NiCAF) Supported Core-Multishell Catalysts for Efficient Catalytic Ozonation: A Structure-to-Performance Study, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 12, pp. 6917-6926, (2019); Wei, Kajia, A hybrid fluidized-bed reactor (HFBR) based on arrayed ceramic membranes (ACMs) coupled with powdered activated carbon (PAC) for efficient catalytic ozonation: A comprehensive study on a pilot scale, Water Research, 173, (2020); Qu, Wei, Electron Transfer Trade-offs in MOF-Derived Cobalt-Embedded Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotubes Boost Catalytic Ozonation for Gaseous Sulfur-Containing VOC Elimination, ACS Catalysis, 13, 1, pp. 692-705, (2023); Lin, Ziyin, Facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene via pyrolysis of graphene oxide and urea, and its electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen-reduction reaction, Advanced Energy Materials, 2, 7, pp. 884-888, (2012); do Minh, Tam, Biochar based catalysts for the abatement of emerging pollutants: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 394, (2020); Zhang, Tao, Surface hydroxyl groups of synthetic α-FeOOH in promoting {radical dot}OH generation from aqueous ozone: Property and activity relationship, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 82, 1-2, pp. 131-137, (2008); Liang, Xiaoshan, Mesoporous poorly crystalline α-Fe2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies and acid sites for ozone decomposition, Science of the Total Environment, 804, (2022)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","21555435","","ACCAC","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186333753"

Different letters indicate significant differences between treatments (p < 0.05). There was an error in the original publication. One of the VOCs found in the volatilome of entomopathogenic and nematophagous fungi was 3-cyclohepten-1-one (also called C7 in the article). The olfactometric tests with banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) were conducted instead with 2-cyclohepten-1-one. The reason being that this was the only isomer commercially available rather than 3-cyclohepten-1-one. A correction has been made to Abstract. Corrected paragraph: Abstract: Fungal Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) repel banana black weevil (BW), Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar, 1824), the key-pest of banana [Musa sp. (Linnaeus, 1753)]. The entomopathogens Beauveria bassiana (Bb1TS11) and Metarhizium robertsii (Mr4TS04) were isolated from banana plantation soils using an insect bait. Bb1TS11 and Mr4TS04 were pathogenic to BW adults. Bb1TS11, Bb203 (from infected palm weevils), Mr4TS04 and the nematophagous fungus Pochonia clamydosporia (Pc123), were tested for VOCs production. VOCs were identified by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry–Solid-Phase Micro Extraction (GC/MS-SPME). GC/MS-SPME identified a total of 97 VOCs in all strains tested. Seven VOCs (styrene, benzothiazole, camphor, borneol, 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene, 1-octen-3-ol and 3-cyclohepten-1-one) were selected for their abundance or previous record as insect repellents. In olfactometry bioassays, BW-starved adults in the dark showed the highest mobility to banana corm. 2-cyclohepten-1-one (C7), commercially available isomer of 3-cyclohepten-1-one, is the best BW repellent (p < 0.05), followed by 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene (C5). The rest of the VOCs have a milder repellency to BW. Styrene (C1) and benzothiazole (C2) (known to repel palm weevil) block the attraction of banana corm and BW pheromone to BW adults in bioassays. Therefore, VOCs from biocontrol fungi can be used in future studies to biomanage BW in the field. A correction has been made to 2. Materials and Methods, 2.8. Fungal VOCs Repellency. Corrected paragraph: In this group, nine bioassays were conducted with starved BW in the dark (D-S). Seven fungal VOCs (C1-C7) (Table S2) and two BW repellents used in commercial banana plantations [67] (garlic, G. and colloidal sulphur, S.) were analyzed. Styrene (C1) and benzothiazole (C2) were selected because they repel R. ferrugineus [68]. B. bassiana 203 and 1TS11 both produced C1 and C2. Camphor (C3) and borneol (C4) were chosen for their repellence of insects [69–71]. C4 is produced by the B. bassiana strains, and C3 is produced only by B. bassiana 1TS11. We selected 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene (C5) and 1-octen-3-ol (C6) from M. robertsii and P. chlamydosporia because of their high abundance (M-VOCs). Finally, 3-cyclohepten-1-one was present in all fungal strains studied and in high abundance. 3-Cyclohepten-1-one was not commercially available and therefore bioassays were performed using the commercial isomer 2-cyclohepten-1-one (C7). Samples of all pure compounds were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Of the VOCs identified using the fungal chromatograms, we tested the six pure substances commercially available for repellence against C. sordidus, except for 3-cyclohepten-1-one, because it was not commercially available. To replace 3-cyclohepten-1-one, we used 2-cyclohepten-1-one, the closest commercially available isomer. The substances were tested as pure compounds one by one and not in mixtures with each other. For the tests, in one arm of the olfactometer a piece of fresh corm/pseudocorm was placed, on the other arm 0.5 mL (C1, C2, C5, C6 and C7) or 0.5 g (C3 and C4) of the pure compounds were inoculated by placing them in a miracloth (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) envelop (3.5 × 2.5 cm) with 2 g of silica gel (60A; 70–200 μ, Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). The volume or weight of the compound was added directly to the silica gel. For the fresh garlic slices (local supermarket) and the colloidal sulphur (Sipcam Jardin S.L., Sipcam, Milan, Italy) 15.6 g of each substance was used. A correction has been made to 3. Results, 3.4. Olfactometer Bioassays, 3.4.2. Fungal VOCs Repel BW. Corrected paragraph: C. sordidus mobility was influenced by fungal VOCs (Table S2) and other compounds (technical repellents) tested (Figure 4A) (χ2 = 60.881; df = 18; p-value = 1.473 × 10−6; ANOVA: F-value = 3.388; p-value = 0.0026). All fungal VOCs and technical repellents, except for colloidal sulphur (S.), reduced BW movement compared to the control (corm only, no repellents). However, significant differences (p < 0.05) were only observed with the commercially available compound 2-cyclohepten-1-one (C7) we used because it is an isomer of 3-cyclohepten-1-one. Both isomers (3-cyclohepten-1-one and 2-cyclohepten-1-one) may impact BW differently. Sulphur showed the highest IM (IM<inf>S</inf> = 0.64) compared to the control (IM<inf>D-S</inf> = 0.53), being significantly different (p < 0.05) with 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene (C5) and C7. The compound that mostly reduced BW mobility was C7 (IM<inf>C7</inf> = 0.11), followed by C5 (IM<inf>C5</inf> = 0.18) produced by P. chlamydosporia 123 and M. roberstii 4TS04 only. Benzothiazole (C2) (IM<inf>C2</inf> = 0.26) and styrene (C1) (IM<inf>C1</inf> = 0.28) were the following ones, showing a decrease in BW mobility. A correction has been made to Section 4. Discussion. Corrected paragraph: Bananas are essential for food security in tropical and subtropical countries, being one of the best-known, consumed and cultivated fruits [72,73]. Cosmopolites sordidus is a major pest of bananas. It causes more crop destruction than any other arthropod pest in all banana producing countries [5]. BW-resistant banana plants do not cover main commercial cultivars, making this pest a severe problem [74–76]. Biological control agents such as entomopathogenic fungi could be used for BW management [5,77]. However, C. sordidus larvae and adults spend most of their life cycle within the banana plant, where it is hard to target them using EF conidia. Moreover, the adults move from plant to plant, hiding in the leaf litter, complicating the use of EF conidia. Lopes et al. [78] reported that C. sordidus adults are less sensitive to B. bassiana in auto-infection systems (mortality ranged between 21.7 and 1%) than other beetles, like Cylas formicarius (Fabricius, 1798) and Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758). In this work, we take an alternative approach for BW biomanagement using fungal VOCs. BWs have efficient search mechanisms based on their antennae, specialized primary chemo and mechanoreceptors, which are crucial to ensure the survival and reproduction of BWs in the environment [13]. Fungi produce volatile compounds [34,35]. Some of them act as attractants and/or repellents for insects and other invertebrates [42,46–52]. These compounds may alert the insect about possible partners, food, suitable places to lay their eggs or dangers that should be avoided. Therefore, any chemical that could interrupt and modify the behaviour of the BW and, in general, its searching ability for the host (Musa sp.) could serve as a tool for BW sustainable management. We have isolated entomopathogenic fungi from banana crop soils in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain), where BW infestations are documented, looking for VOCs that are repellent to BW. Beauveria bassiana (1TS11) and M. robertsii (4TS04), both pathogenic to BW, were selected for VOC analysis from this survey. These fungi are common in agricultural fields [79] and banana crops [78]. Since B. bassiana 203 produces VOCs repellent to R. ferrugineus [68], it was included in this study. Pochonia chlamydosporia 123, a nematophagous fungus closely related to M. anisopliae [20,21], with a large array of secondary metabolites [80] was also tested for VOC production. Genomic studies support that some Metarhizium species and P. chlamydosporia have a single ancestral joint [21]. These fungi produce a total of 97 VOCs. The VOC 3-cyclohepten-1-one, one of the main VOCs produced by all fungal strains [81], was not tested on C. sordidus because it was not commercially available. However, its isomer 2-cyclohepten-1-one (C7) reduced BW mobility most among the seven VOCs tested. Previous work found that stereoisomers and isomers can be equally repellent to insects, while other studies describe that insect repellence was different for various piperidine isomers. We do not know how 3-cyclohepten-1-one acts as a repellent, but the most similar isomer, 2-cyclohepten-1-one, repels BW. We decided to test 2-cyclohepten-1-one as a first approach to validate cycloheptenes as BW repellents. The synthesis of 3-cyclohepten-1-one in the laboratory is complex, expensive, and tedious (involving oxidation and ring closure). 3-cyclohepten-1-one is also the most unstable cycloheptene isomer because it isomerizes the double bond to form the more stable 2-cyclohepten-1-one (used in this study as C7). Therefore, 3-cyclohepten-1-one is unavailable in the quantities required for bioassays, let alone field trials. Electroantennography of experimentally synthesized 3-cyclohepten-1-one could, however, be performed in future studies. The 1,3-dimethoxy-benzene (C5) from P. chlamydosporia and M. robertsii cultures was the second most repellent VOC to C. sordidus. Camphor (C3) and borneol (C4), produced by B. bassiana and B. pseudobassiana, moderately reduce BW movement. These are known insect repellents [69–71,82]. 1-octen-3-ol (C6), responsible for the odour of many fungi [83,84], is a milder repellent to C. sordidus. Styrene (C1) and benzothiazole (C2) are also repellent to C. sordidus. They can reduce banana corm and pheromone (sordidine) attractiveness to BW. A correction has been made to Section 5. Conclusions. In this work, we have identified new VOCs from EF and a nematophagous fungus that can be used as BW repellents. 1,3-Dimethoxy-benzene (C5), styrene (C1), benzothiazole (C2), camphor (C3), borneol (C4), 1-octen-3-ol (C6) and 2-cyclohepten-1-one (C7) reduced BW mobility and can therefore be considered for BW management. Because 3-cyclohepten-1-one is unstable, difficult to synthesise, and not commercially available, we evaluated the repellence of 2-cyclohepten-1-one. In addition, C1 and C2 mask sordidine, the commercial BW aggregation pheromone. Tests should be conducted to determine the effect of selected VOCs as BW repellents in the field. Using VOCs and slow-release polymer matrices would improve VOCs’ performance and durability in the field. Implementing the technologies associated with the dispersion of these repellents could produce advancements in the agrobiotechnological sustainability of world banana cultivation. The economic importance of BW at a global level justifies the continuation of research in identifying new molecules and technologies for the genesis of these new means of bio-management. Managing C. sordidus in an integrated way could contribute to the increase in banana production, significantly contributing to the increase in global food production, given the extent and importance of this crop. The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor.

Antibiotic usage has increased for more than 40% from last 15 years globally per day in both human populations and farm animals leading to the large-scale discharge of antibiotic residues into wastewater. Most antibiotics end up in sewer systems, either directly from industry or healthcare systems, or indirectly from humans and animals after being partially metabolized or broken down following consumption. To prevent additional antibiotic compound pollution, which eventually impacts on the spread of antibiotic resistance, it is crucial to remove antibiotic residues from wastewater. Antibiotic accumulation and antibiotic resistance genes cannot be effectively and efficiently eliminated by conventional sewage treatment plants. Because of their high energy requirements and operating costs, many of the available technologies are not feasible. However, the biosorption method, which uses low-cost biomass as the biosorbent, is an alternative technique to potentially address these problems. An extensive literature survey focusing on developments in the field was conducted using English language electronic databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Pubag, Google books, and ResearchGate, to understand the relative value of the available antibiotic removal methods. The predominant techniques for eliminating antibiotic residues from wastewater were categorized and defined by example. The approaches were contrasted, and the benefits and drawbacks were highlighted.

Lastly, a few representative publications were identified that provide specific information on the removal rates attained by each technique.

Results demonstrated that PI could be successfully activated by NTP and promoted the degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ). When amount of PI was 6 mmol/L, the performance of activation achieved the highest. SDZ degradation efficiency reached 98.9 % within 12 min under NTP/PI system, which was 25.2 % higher than that in sole NTP system. The hv, H•, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and electrons generated by NTP may be involved in PI activation. Active species including •OH, IO<inf>3</inf>•, 1O<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>2</inf>•- and electrons were proven to play role in SDZ degradation. The active species dominated to SDZ degradation were explored based on experiments and density functional theory (DFT). The toxicity of SDZ was declined after NTP/PI treatment. Higher input power and lower concentration were conductive to degradation of SDZ. Compared with alkaline and neutral condition, higher degradation efficiency of SDZ was attained at acidic condition. TOC and COD removal both increased with addition of PI. NTP/PI system was proven to be suitable for efficient removal of other emerging contaminants including sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol A and ciprofloxacin. In different water bodies, SDZ can also be effectively removed by NTP/PI system. The energy efficiency (G<inf>50</inf>) of NTP/PI for SDZ degradation could reach 230.77 mg/kWh, which was much higher that of the reported methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging Contaminants; Non-thermal Plasma; Periodate Activation; Sulfadiazine","","","","We would like to thank for the financial support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22006069 ), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province in China (No. BK20200801 ), Natural Science Research of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institution of China (No. 20KJB610015 ), Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province in China (No. 2021K592C ), and Jiangsu Special Foundation on Technology Innovation of Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality (No. BK20220016 ).","Kvam, Erik, Nonthermal atmospheric plasma rapidly disinfects multidrug-resistant microbes by inducing cell surface damage, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 56, 4, pp. 2028-2036, (2012); Scholtz, Vladimír, Non-thermal plasma disinfecting procedure is harmless to delicate items of everyday use, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Beaudette, Chad A., Nonthermal Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition of Two-Dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide, ACS Omega, 5, 34, pp. 21853-21861, (2020); Schäfer, Jan, Liquid assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition with a non-thermal plasma jet at atmospheric pressure, Thin Solid Films, 630, pp. 71-78, (2017); Jafarian Asl, Parisa, Non-thermal plasma technique for preservation of fresh foods: A review, Food Control, 134, (2022); Preis, Sergei V., Potential of electric discharge plasma methods in abatement of volatile organic compounds originating from the food industry, Journal of Environmental Management, 114, pp. 125-138, (2013); Helbich, Steffen, Styrene and bioaerosol removal from waste air with a combined biotrickling filter and DBD– plasma system, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 21, pp. 1-23, (2020); Mildažienė, Vida, Effects of Non-Thermal Plasma Treatment on Plant Physiological and Biochemical Processes, Plants, 11, 8, (2022); Dobslaw, Daniel, A combined process of non-thermal plasma and a low-cost mineral adsorber for VOC removal and odor abatement in emissions of organic waste treatment plants, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, 6, 2, pp. 2281-2289, (2018); Lei, Lang, Current applications and future impact of machine learning in emerging contaminants: A review, Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 20, pp. 1817-1835, (2023)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185161691"

We demonstrate that the efficacy and specificity of detecting and differentiating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be significantly enhanced using a range of slightly varied MOFs. These variations are obtained via postsynthetic modification (PSM) of a primary framework. We alter the original MOF’s guest adsorption affinities by incorporating functional groups into the MOF linkers, which yields subtle changes in responses. These responses are subsequently evaluated by using machine learning (ML) techniques. Under severe conditions, such as high humidity and acidic environments, sensor stability and lifespan are of utmost importance. The UiO-66-X MOFs demonstrate the necessary durability in acidic, neutral, and basic environments with pH values ranging from 2 to 11, thus surpassing most other similar materials. The UiO-66-NH<inf>2</inf> thin films were deposited on quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors in a high-temperature QCM liquid cell using a layer-by-layer pump method. Three different, highly stable surface-anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) of UiO-66-X obtained via the PSM approach (X: NH<inf>2</inf>, Cl, and N<inf>3</inf>) were employed to fabricate arrays suitable for electronic nose applications. These fabricated sensors were tested for their capability to distinguish between eight VOCs. Data from the sensor array were processed using three distinct ML techniques: linear discriminant (LDA), nearest neighbor (k-NN), and neural network analysis methods. The discrimination accuracies achieved were nearly 100% at high concentrations and over 95% at lower concentrations (50-100 ppm). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Discrimination; Electronic Nose; Harsh Conditions; Layer-by-layer; Mof; Stability; Surmof; Voc; Metal-organic Frameworks; Phthalic Acids; Uio-66; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption; Metal-organic Frameworks; Nearest Neighbor Search; Quartz Crystal Microbalances; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption Affinity; Condition; Discrimination; Harsh Condition; Layer By Layer; Machine Learning Techniques; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Nano-porous; Postsynthetic Modification; Surface-anchored Mof; Electronic Nose; Metal Organic Framework; Phthalic Acid Derivative; Uio-66; Volatile Organic Compound; Adsorption; Phthalic Acids; Volatile Organic Compounds","Adsorption; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Nearest neighbor search; Quartz crystal microbalances; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption affinity; Condition; Discrimination; Harsh condition; Layer by layer; Machine learning techniques; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Nano-porous; Postsynthetic modification; Surface-anchored MOF; Electronic nose; metal organic framework; phthalic acid derivative; UiO-66; volatile organic compound; adsorption; Phthalic Acids; Volatile Organic Compounds","","Metal-Organic Frameworks; Phthalic Acids; UiO-66; Volatile Organic Compounds","S.O., T.H., S.B., and C.W. acknowledge support through the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the Cluster “3DMM2O” funded by Germany’s Excellence Strategy −2082/1–390761711.","Bon, Volodymyr V., Unraveling Structure and Dynamics in Porous Frameworks via Advanced In Situ Characterization Techniques, Advanced Functional Materials, 30, 41, (2020); Gándara-Loe, Jesús, Understanding the opportunities of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for CO2capture and gas-phase CO2conversion processes: A comprehensive overview, Reaction Chemistry and Engineering, 6, 5, pp. 787-814, (2021); von Helden, Gert, Resonant ionization using IR light: A new tool to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of gas-phase molecules and clusters, Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 107, 11, pp. 1671-1688, (2003); Silva, Patrícia R., Multifunctional metal-organic frameworks: From academia to industrial applications, Chemical Society Reviews, 44, 19, pp. 6774-6803, (2015); Liu, Jinxuan, Surface-supported metal-organic framework thin films: Fabrication methods, applications, and challenges, Chemical Society Reviews, 46, 19, pp. 5730-5770, (2017); Wang, Cheng, Metal-organic frameworks as a tunable platform for designing functional molecular materials, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 135, 36, pp. 13222-13234, (2013); Eddaoudi, M., Modular chemistry: Secondary building units as a basis for the design of highly porous and robust metal-organic carboxylate frameworks, Accounts of Chemical Research, 34, 4, pp. 319-330, (2001); Li, Ying, Synthesis and shaping of metal-organic frameworks: a review, Chemical Communications, 58, 82, pp. 11488-11506, (2022); Ahmadi, Mahnaz, Microporous metal–organic frameworks: Synthesis and applications, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 115, pp. 1-11, (2022); Altaf, Amna, Recent progress in the design, synthesis and applications of chiral metal-organic frameworks, Frontiers in Chemistry, 10, (2022)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","23793694","","","38320750","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185268050"

While competition between these 2 species has been studied extensively, there is little information on spatial dispersion patterns in bulk storage of grain.To evaluate potential overlap in realized niche, we evaluated the short-term spatial dispersion behavior of P. truncatus and S. zeamais in monolayers of maize alone or together for 1 day compared to 7 days. We evaluated competition under three different densities, namely 10–20, 75–150, and 150–300 insects/kg for P. truncatus and S. zeamais.The monolayers were equally divided into 24 zones to track location the abundance of insects and damage to maize. We found that both species generally aggregated together and were correlated to the same location as heterospecifics. After 1 day, most of the insects for both species were near the top of the monolayer, but by 7 days, most individuals were at the bottom of the monolayers. In monolayers, when alone, P. truncatus created a clear path of destruction to the bottom of the monolayer, but when S. zeamais was present, damage was lessened and shifted upwards in the grain column.

N-hexane is a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon that is a major precursor of ozone. For the decomposition of n-hexane, a novel double dielectric barrier discharge (DDBD) reactor design is developed and tested on a pilot scale. The factors influencing the plasma degradation of n-hexane have been thoroughly investigated. The degradation efficiency, carbon balance and nitrogen oxide concentration were measured and analysed. Through experiments, it was found that the maximum removal of n-hexane at an initial concentration of 2000 ppm and a flow rate of 5 L/min was 1544 ppm. The associated energy efficiency reached 67.71 ppm/J. The excited states of oxygen and nitrogen (O<inf>2</inf>+, O(3 s5S-3p5P), N<inf>2</inf>(C3Π<inf>u</inf>-B3Π<inf>g</inf>), N<inf>2</inf>+(B2Σ<inf>u</inf>+-X2Σ<inf>g</inf>+)) during n-hexane degradation were observed. Possible degradation pathways of n-hexane are proposed, and it is revealed that the active species play an important role in the formation of oxygen and nitrogen-containing volatile organic by-products. The results show that the pilot-scale design of the DDBD system provides a feasible way for the industrial treatment of n-hexane, and provides fundamental insights into the mechanism of plasma catalytic system operation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Substances; In-situ Diagnostics; Pilot-scale Plasma Reactor; Plasma Decomposition Analysis; Vocs Abatement; Degradation; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Energy Efficiency; Flow Control; Hexane; Nitrogen Oxides; Oxygen; Plasma Applications; Volatile Organic Compounds; Active Substance; Decomposition Analysis; In-situ Diagnostic; Pilot Scale; Pilot-scale Plasma Reactor; Plasma Decomposition; Plasma Decomposition Analyse; Plasma Reactors; Situ Diagnostics; Volatile Organic Compound Abatement; Dielectric Barrier Discharge","Degradation; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Energy efficiency; Flow control; Hexane; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Plasma applications; Volatile organic compounds; Active substance; Decomposition analysis; In-situ diagnostic; Pilot scale; Pilot-scale plasma reactor; Plasma decomposition; Plasma decomposition analyse; Plasma reactors; Situ diagnostics; Volatile organic compound abatement; Dielectric barrier discharge","","","This publication was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22108255 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 22378365 ), and the State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Sources and Control of Air Pollution Complex ( SCAPC202108 ).

Their control and treatment are urgently needed. Catalytic oxidation is a promising remediation technology, particularly suitable for the end − of − pipe treatment of VOCs. Developing highly efficient catalysts is crucial to the wide adaptation of this technology. Zeolite − supported metallic catalysts are among the best choices due to their excellent porosity and structure, adjustable acidity and high stability, which are essential to the catalyst performance. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art in zeolite-based catalyst development, with a focus on three typical ones - ZSM − 5 (MFI), beta (BEA) and X−/Y − zeolite (FAU), for VOC oxidation. Specifically, we examine their chemical characteristics, active center dispersion and stability, the structure, surface acidity and hydrophobicity of the support, and elucidate the synergy between the active centers and the support. Moreover, we document the detailed preparation procedures to modulate these aspects of catalysts, providing a comprehensive guide to designing zeolite − based catalysts for VOC emission control. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Oxidation; Modification Strategies; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Zeolite−based Catalyst; Catalyst Supports; Catalytic Oxidation; Chemical Stability; Volatile Organic Compounds; Active Center; Ecological Environments; Emission Of Volatile Organic Compounds; Human Health; Modification Strategy; Remediation Technologies; Thermal; Volatile Organic Compound; Zeolite−based Catalyst; ]+ Catalyst; Zeolites","Catalyst supports; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical stability; Volatile organic compounds; Active center; Ecological environments; Emission of volatile organic compounds; Human health; Modification strategy; Remediation technologies; Thermal; Volatile organic compound; Zeolite−based catalyst; ]+ catalyst; Zeolites","","","We are thankful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52370116), the Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province (2022NSFSC0992), and the Sichuan Science and Technology Plan Project (2023ZHCG0057) for supporting this work.","He, Chi, Recent Advances in the Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds: A Review Based on Pollutant Sorts and Sources, Chemical Reviews, 119, 7, pp. 4471-4568, (2019); Guo, Yunlong, Recent advances in VOC elimination by catalytic oxidation technology onto various nanoparticles catalysts: a critical review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 281, (2021); Zhu, Lingli, A critical review on VOCs adsorption by different porous materials: Species, mechanisms and modification methods, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 389, (2020); Wu, Xueqian, A review of confined-structure catalysts in the catalytic oxidation of VOCs: Synthesis, characterization, and applications, Catalysis Science and Technology, 11, 16, pp. 5374-5387, (2021); Huang, Yu Sing, Removal of indoor volatile organic compounds via photocatalytic oxidation: A short review and prospect, Molecules, 21, 1, (2016); Environmental Protection, (2020); Lee, Jung-eun, Recent advances in volatile organic compounds abatement by catalysis and catalytic hybrid processes: A critical review, Science of the Total Environment, 719, (2020); Simayi, Maimaiti, Emission trends of industrial VOCs in China since the clean air action and future reduction perspectives, Science of the Total Environment, 826, (2022); Zheng, Chenghang, Quantitative assessment of industrial VOC emissions in China: Historical trend, spatial distribution, uncertainties, and projection, Atmospheric Environment, 150, pp. 116-125, (2017); Li, Xiuquan, Adsorption materials for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the key factors for VOCs adsorption process: A review, Separation and Purification Technology, 235, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18733794; 13835866","","SPUTF","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174849612"

To reduce the amount of these pollutants in the atmosphere, it has been necessary to introduce strict government regulations. In the bakery industry specifically, great attention is paid to the abatement of ethyl alcohol emissions released from the cooking chambers of industrial ovens. To control these emissions, VOC abatement devices are adopted, generally based on thermal and non-thermal technologies. After a detailed review of the most common systems for VOC reduction, the different technologies were evaluated by means of a technical-economic feasibility study focusing on an industrial bakery plant located in northern Italy, to identify the optimal abatement technology, intended as the solution that reaches the best trade-off among the legislative, environmental and economic aspects.

The application of AD systems still faces challenges due to process stability, digestate management, high costs, and regulatory concerns and requirements among others. In many cases, it is often difficult for a traditional AD system to be economically viable because of all the related costs (e.g., capital, operating, disposal). These issues can be addressed via the following strategies: (1) improving conversion efficiency from waste feedstocks to final products; (2) producing higher-value products, including co-products, to offset the costs; (3) reducing the cost of digestate disposal, and (4) developing integrated systems by combining the above strategies. In addition to general operational approaches, pretreatment such as thermal hydrolysis and advanced reactor designs can increase conversion efficiency. Combining microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) with AD can enhance methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) production rates and CH<inf>4</inf> contents beyond traditional AD systems. An alternative emerging concept is arrested methanogenesis, in which methanogens are inhibited or suppressed to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which can be utilized as precursors for higher-value products, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) polymer and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Tuning of AD microbial communities via proper control of operating conditions/parameters is essential for maximizing the production of desired products such as VFAs. Advanced microbial management strategies depend on a better understanding of microbiomes’ roles and functions in digesters and their interactions. The conversion of biogas to transportation fuels and bioproducts via biogas upgrading provides an alternative to fossil fuels and promotes wider adoption of AD technologies. Finally, improved digestate management technologies, beyond land applications, are emerging that combine beneficial use with a reduction in pollutants. This paper systematically reviews emerging technologies to improve the AD process and digestate management, including pretreatment and digester design, MET, arrested methanogenesis, PHA production, biogas upgrading, and digestate handling. Current challenges and technological gaps, and future research and development needs are also discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anaerobic Digestion; Arrested Methanogenesis; Digestate; Microbial Electrochemical Technologies; Thermal Hydrolysis","","","","At present, dynamic filtration systems are predominantly utilized in the paper and food industries, with limited applications in anaerobic digestion (AD) plants.

In response to ozone stress, plants activate various defense mechanisms, including secondary metabolism. Secondary metabolites are organic compounds that are not directly involved in plant growth and development but serve multiple functions, such as defense against herbivores, pathogens, and protection against abiotic stresses. This review aims to accomplish the following objectives: (i) comprehensively understand the physiological functions, significance, and interconnections between plant secondary metabolism and environmental factors; (ii) analyze the impact of ozone stress on both volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites in plants; and (iii) explore the defense mechanisms of plant non-volatile secondary metabolites against ozone stress, focusing on plant pigments, hormones, and active ingredients. Furthermore, we summarize the severity of ozone pollution and the role of plant secondary metabolism in alleviating ozone toxicity and facilitating plant adaptation to ozone-polluted environments. Additionally, we review relevant studies on the effects of ozone stress on plant secondary metabolism and investigate the protective mechanisms of plant secondary metabolites in response to ozone stress. Gaining insights into the synthesis and regulation mechanisms of specific metabolites in plants under ozone stress is vital for comprehending the protective and defensive effects of plant secondary metabolism. The examination of protective mechanisms utilized by plant secondary metabolism under ozone stress is an essential aspect of ecological research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds; Ozone (o3); Plant Defense Mechanisms; Secondary Metabolism; Volatile And Non-volatile Secondary Metabolites; Growth And Development; Metabolism; Oxidative Stress; Ozone; Plant Defense; Secondary Metabolite; Volatile Organic Compound","growth and development; metabolism; oxidative stress; ozone; plant defense; secondary metabolite; volatile organic compound","","","This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 31600486 ), Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (grant numbers C2017204047 ), Science and Research Development Foundation of Hebei Agricultural University ( JY2020023 ).","Abbas, Farhat, Volatile organic compounds as mediators of plant communication and adaptation to climate change, Physiologia Plantarum, 174, 6, (2022); Acton, William Joe F., The effect of ozone fumigation on the biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from Brassica napus above- and below-ground, PLOS ONE, 13, 12, (2018); Agathokleous, Evgenios, Ozone affects plant, insect, and soil microbial communities: A threat to terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, Science Advances, 6, 33, (2020); Agathokleous, Evgenios, Ozone pollution disrupts plant–pollinator systems, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 37, 11, pp. 939-941, (2022); Ansari, Naushad, An assessment of growth, floral morphology, and metabolites of a medicinal plant Sida cordifolia L. under the influence of elevated ozone, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 1, pp. 832-845, (2021); Aono, Mitsuko, Regulation of ascorbate contents by jasmonate-mediated signaling pathway in Arabidopsis during ozone exposure, Phyton - Annales Rei Botanicae, 45, 4, pp. 201-207, (2005); Aslam, Saima, Role of Jasmonates, Calcium, and Glutathione in Plants to Combat Abiotic Stresses Through Precise Signaling Cascade, Frontiers in Plant Science, 12, (2021); Baier, Margarete, Oxidative stress and ozone: Perception, signalling and response, Plant, Cell and Environment, 28, 8, pp. 1012-1020, (2005); Bellini, Erika, Ascorbic acid and ozone: Novel perspectives to explain an elusive relationship, Plants, 8, 5, (2019); Calfapietra, Carlo, Response and potential of agroforestry crops under global change, Environmental Pollution, 158, 4, pp. 1095-1104, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00988472","","EEBOD","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176285445"

Although a plethora of photocatalysts have been developed to degrade VOCs under ambient conditions, their practical feasibility has often been confined by their short lifetime (rapid deactivation) and/or wide bandgap (activation under ultraviolet radiation). In light of such limitations, the feasibility of various strategies (e.g., doping with metal/nonmetal ions, coupling with other semiconductors, surface engineering, morphology modification, and miscellaneous approaches) has been explored toward the visible-light photodegradation of both polar and nonpolar VOC (i.e., formaldehyde and toluene, respectively as the model compound) in terms of the key performance metrics such as quantum yield (QY) and space–time yield (STY) values. According to the STY-based evaluation (molecules/photon/g), the construction of composite photocatalysts such as Au@Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> and ultra-small C-doped TiO<inf>2</inf>/carbon cloth substrate has been identified as the best mitigation strategy for formaldehyde (2.4E-02) and toluene (9.3E-01), respectively.

Multi-component BTEX adsorption capacity decreased significantly with the increasing temperature and humidity. The adsorption of the BTEX mixture on EM38-ACs decreased by 28.5–35.4%, compared to the relative humidity of 30 and 90%. Also, the reusability of EM38-ACs showed good thermal regeneration and fell to 84.55% after seven cycles.

A range of reaction temperatures (220–320°C) and NTP discharge field strengths (2.06–6.87 kV/cm) were studied for the individual and interactive effects regarding the glycerol conversion and product selectivity. Results showed that the presence of NTP always improved the glycerol conversion, and NTP increased acrolein selectivity if properly conditioned. An optimal condition of 275°C and 4.58 kV/cm NTP field strength achieved a glycerol conversion of 94.4 mol%, acrolein selectivity of 88.0 mol%, with an acrolein yield of 83.1 mol%, representing a 10% improvement in acrolein production over that conducted at the same temperature but without NTP.

Their unique structural properties, including large surface area to volume ratio with multi-functionalities and ultra-high porosity, tunability, uniformity, and easy derivation and fabrication, render them effective materials for sensing applications. The detection of heavy metals in different environmental matrices using various MOF-based sensors is in practice. They include luminescent, electrochemical, electrochemiluminescent, colorimetric, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering, are of great interest. This review elaborates on selected synthetic methods for the fabrication of MOF-based sensors, modification routes for tailoring and enhancing the desired properties, basic characterization techniques, and their limitations in the detection of heavy metals. Also, it emphasizes the use of various types of MOF-based sensors alternatively for the detection of different heavy metals such as Fe(III), Cr(III), Hg(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) in addition to a normal metal Al(III).

They are a health hazard to humans and a bad odor. We propose a wet-type catalytic nonthermal plasma (NTP) technology to control VOC emissions. This technology is expected to achieve highly efficient VOC removal due to the combined effects of NTP and catalyst, and has the advantage of not emitting byproducts, which can be a problem during VOC removal, because the byproducts generated are absorbed by water dissolution. In this study, the typical VOCs toluene, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid, as well as the odor pollutant ammonia, are removed by changing the water circulation flow rate, and the byproducts generated during removal are analyzed. As a result, removal rates of toluene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and ammonia were 59%, 97%, 100%, and 100% at maximum, respectively. Analysis of byproducts by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer showed that HCHO and CH3COOH formed in the dry process were water-soluble and undetectable in the wet process. During toluene removal, the amount of ozone generated in the dry process was reduced from 300 ppm to 60 ppm in the wet process, confirming that the wet process reduces the amount of ozone generated. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Byproducts; Catalysis; Nonthermal Plasma; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wet-type Reactor; Acetic Acid; Air Pollution; Health Hazards; Odor Removal; Photochemical Reactions; Plasma Applications; Shotcreting; Spectrometers; Toluene; Water Pollution; Catalyse; Compound Decomposition; Dry Process; Nonthermal Plasma; Nonthermal Plasma Reactors; Photochemical Smog; Volatile Organic Compound Removals; Volatile Organics; Wet Process; Wet-type Reactor; Byproducts; Volatile Organic Compounds","Acetic acid; Air pollution; Health hazards; Odor removal; Photochemical reactions; Plasma applications; Shotcreting; Spectrometers; Toluene; Water pollution; Catalyse; Compound decomposition; Dry process; Nonthermal plasma; Nonthermal plasma reactors; Photochemical smog; Volatile organic compound removals; Volatile organics; Wet process; Wet-type reactor; Byproducts; Volatile organic compounds","","","This study was supported by a project fund (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP23H01626).","Yamasaki, Haruhiko, Toward Ideal VOCs and Nanoparticle Emission Control Technology Using a Wet-Type Catalysis Nonthermal Plasma Reactor, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 58, 5, pp. 6591-6598, (2022); Zou, Weixin, Integrated adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using carbon-based nanocomposites: A critical review, Chemosphere, 218, pp. 845-859, (2019); He, Chi, Recent Advances in the Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds: A Review Based on Pollutant Sorts and Sources, Chemical Reviews, 119, 7, pp. 4471-4568, (2019); Wu, Peng, Recent Progress of Thermocatalytic and Photo/Thermocatalytic Oxidation for VOCs Purification over Manganese-based Oxide Catalysts, Environmental Science and Technology, 55, 8, pp. 4268-4286, (2021); Yu, Kuo Pin, Decomposition of gas-phase toluene by the combination of ozone and photocatalytic oxidation process (TiO2/UV, TiO2/UV/O3, and UV/O3), Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 75, 1-2, pp. 29-38, (2007); Li, Xiuquan, Adsorption materials for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the key factors for VOCs adsorption process: A review, Separation and Purification Technology, 235, (2020); Liang, Zhishu, Removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from a textile dyeing wastewater treatment plant and the attenuation of respiratory health risks using a pilot-scale biofilter, Journal of Cleaner Production, 253, (2020); Mustafa, Muhammad Farooq, Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) removal in non-thermal plasma double dielectric barrier discharge reactor, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 347, pp. 317-324, (2018); Karatum, Osman, A comparative study of dilute VOCs treatment in a non-thermal plasma reactor, Chemical Engineering Journal, 294, pp. 308-315, (2016); Li, Shijie, The application of dielectric barrier discharge non-thermal plasma in VOCs abatement: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 388, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2024 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, IAS 2024","","Phoenix; AZ","209530","01608592; 01972618","9780780304536; 9781467352024; 9781424422791; 9781424434763; 9781424463954; 9781665478151; 0780384865; 9781424494989; 9781467303309; 0780392086","CIASD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008642313"

In this study, mesoporous γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> supported Mn–Ce–Co ternary oxides were introduced into a widely employed tubular dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) reactor for indoor air purification. The plasma-catalytic degradation of HCHO exhibited the following degradation efficiency order: Mn–Ce–Co/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> > Mn/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> > Mn–Ce/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> > Co/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> > γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> > Ce/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> > Plasma.

Additionally, the concentrations of the byproducts O<inf>3</inf> and NO<inf>x</inf> were significantly reduced by 88.2% and 93.3%, respectively. The synergistic interaction between Mn, Ce and Co oxides facilitated the formation and transportation of surface-reactive oxygen species, thereby contributing to the thorough oxidation of HCHO and organic intermediates during the plasma-catalytic process.

This source has been tested for the decomposition of toluene and benzene in an enclosed environment of size 12 ft3. Study has been performed to compare decomposition of toluene and benzene on various combinations of the applied voltages and frequencies. For about 60 min of continuous operation of the SDBD source, a decomposition efficiency of 99.7% (toluene) and 74.8% (benzene) has been achieved. For the effective generation of reactive species, the ground electrode of the SDBD source is coated with TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles. Optical emission spectroscopy diagnostic has also been used to estimate the electron temperature, which is found to be in the range of 3–6 eV. Consequently, the high energetic electrons produced via the SDBD source are the primary reason to activate the catalyst instead of ultra-violet (UV) light. The results further showed that the developed SDBD source produces powerful, immediate discharge and energetic electrons, which could be efficiently used for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) degradation. The need for feed gas, pellets and/or differential pressure has been eliminated by the developed SDBD source from the known conventional methods for VOCs decomposition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dbd; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Non-thermal Plasma; Ntp; Toluene And Benzene; Voc; Volatile Organic Compounds; Benzene; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Electron Scattering; Electron Temperature; Flow Control; Ionization Of Gases; Optical Emission Spectroscopy; Tio2 Nanoparticles; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Bipolar Pulsed Power; Dbd; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasmas; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Discharge Source; Nonthermal Plasma; Ntp; Pulsed-power Supplies; Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Toluene And Benzene; Volatile Organic Compounds","Benzene; Dielectric barrier discharge; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electron scattering; Electron temperature; Flow control; Ionization of gases; Optical emission spectroscopy; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Toluene; Bipolar pulsed power; DBD; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Dielectric barrier discharges; Discharge source; Nonthermal plasma; NTP; Pulsed-power supplies; Surface dielectric barrier discharge; Toluene and benzene; Volatile organic compounds","","","RJ and KA would like to acknowledge UGC for providing senior research fellowship during PhD program.

In this work, MMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> (M = Cu, Co, Ni, Mg) catalysts were prepared via a redox-precipitation method to explore the catalytic ozonation mechanism of EA. Among all the catalysts, CuMn exhibited superior catalytic activity at 120 °C, achieving nearly 100% EA conversion and above 90% CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity with an O<inf>3</inf>/EA molar ratio of 10. Many characterizations were conducted, such as SEM, BET and XPS, for revealing the properties of the catalysts. Plentiful active sites, abundant oxygen vacancies, more acid sites and higher reduction ability contributed to the excellent performance of CuMn. Moreover, the addition of NO induced a degree of inhibition to EA conversion due to its competition for ozone. H<inf>2</inf>O had little effect on the catalytic ozonation of CuMn, as the conversion of EA could reach a stable platform at ~89% even with 5.0 vol.% of H<inf>2</inf>O. The presence of SO<inf>2</inf> usually caused catalyst deactivation. However, the conversion could gradually recover once SO<inf>2</inf> was discontinued due to the reactivation of ozone.

Comprehensive physicochemical characterization via catalyst characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, BET, confirmed the successful synthesis of the catalysts. These analyses revealed excellent crystallinity, distinctive lamellar structure, and remarkable thermal stability for three synthesized catalysts. The experimental results demonstrate that post non-thermal plasma (post-NTP) catalytic system has significantly improved the degradation efficiency, CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity, and carbon balance for toluene, while notably suppressing the formation of by-products (e.g., NO<inf>x</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>) compared to the NTP alone system. Among the three MMn-LDHs, NiMn-LDHs exhibited the best performance in the post-NTP-catalytic system, achieving a toluene degradation rate of 95.87%, a CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity of 57.41%, a carbon balance of 79.86%, and an energy efficiency of 3.19 g·kWh−1 at a specific energy density (SED) of 930.45 J/L. The catalytic degradation mechanism of toluene was proposed based on a combination of catalyst characterization techniques, plasma emission spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The findings revealed that plasma discharge generated a substantial amount of free radicals and active species, thereby promoting the decomposition of toluene. Subsequently, the residual toluene and intermediate products were adsorbed onto the catalysts, where they underwent further reacted with the abundant hydroxyl radicals and activate metal species on the catalyst surface, ultimately decomposing into CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O. Additionally, the interaction of ozone with LDHs facilitated the generation of reactive oxygen species, consequently accelerating the decomposition of organic intermediates, formation of CO<inf>2</inf>, and the enhancement of toluene mineralization. The finding in this work offer valuable theoretical support for the plasma-catalytic degradation of VOCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","By-products; Layered Double Hydroxides Catalysts; Non-thermal Plasma; Toluene Decomposition; Carbon; Catalysts; Crystallinity; Degradation; Electric Discharges; Emission Spectroscopy; Energy Efficiency; Free Radicals; Gas Chromatography; Manganese Compounds; Mass Spectrometry; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Carbon Balance; Catalyst Characterization; Catalytic Degradation; Catalytic System; Characterization Techniques; Layered Double Hydroxide Catalyst; Layered-double Hydroxides; Nonthermal Plasma; Toluene Decomposition; ]+ Catalyst; Carbon Dioxide","Carbon; Catalysts; Crystallinity; Degradation; Electric discharges; Emission spectroscopy; Energy efficiency; Free radicals; Gas chromatography; Manganese compounds; Mass spectrometry; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Carbon balance; Catalyst characterization; Catalytic degradation; Catalytic system; Characterization techniques; Layered double hydroxide catalyst; Layered-double hydroxides; Nonthermal plasma; Toluene decomposition; ]+ catalyst; Carbon dioxide","","","This authors acknowledge support: from the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20221405 ), the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province ( SJCX22_1455 ) and of Jiangsu University of Technology ( XSJCX22_66 ), the Changzhou Science and Technology Bureau ( CQ20210103 , CM20223017 ).","Veerapandian, Savita K.P., Abatement of VOCs using packed bed non-thermal plasma reactors: A review, Catalysts, 7, 4, (2017); Kamal, Muhammad Shahzad, Catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - A review, Atmospheric Environment, 140, pp. 117-134, (2016); Wu, Peng, Recent Progress of Thermocatalytic and Photo/Thermocatalytic Oxidation for VOCs Purification over Manganese-based Oxide Catalysts, Environmental Science and Technology, 55, 8, pp. 4268-4286, (2021); Yang, Cuiting, Abatement of various types of VOCs by adsorption/catalytic oxidation: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 370, pp. 1128-1153, (2019); Li, Shijie, The application of dielectric barrier discharge non-thermal plasma in VOCs abatement: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 388, (2020); Yu, Huan, Decomposition efficiency and aerosol by-products of toluene, ethyl acetate and acetone using dielectric barrier discharge technique, Chemosphere, 237, (2019); Han, Fenglei, Product analysis and mechanism of toluene degradation by low temperature plasma with single dielectric barrier discharge, Journal of Saudi Chemical Society, 24, 9, pp. 673-682, (2020); Saleem, Faisal, Temperature dependence of non-thermal plasma assisted hydrocracking of toluene to lower hydrocarbons in a dielectric barrier discharge reactor, Chemical Engineering Journal, 356, pp. 1062-1069, (2019); Ondarts, Michel, Non-Thermal Plasma for indoor air treatment: Toluene degradation in a corona discharge at ppbv levels, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 118, pp. 194-205, (2017); Lu, Wenjing, A review on application of dielectric barrier discharge plasma technology on the abatement of volatile organic compounds, Frontiers of Environmental Science and Engineering, 13, 2, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22133437","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176229470"

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of a laboratory-scale ozone-assisted indirect plasma method for formaldehyde removal using response surface methodology (RSM). A dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor was used for ozone generation. Inlet HCHO concentration, ozone concentration, and residence time were considered the design parameters, and formaldehyde removal efficiency (response 1) and energy yield (response 2) were considered response parameters. The optimized models showed a positive correlation between the predicted and experimental outcomes. Inlet ozone concentration, the most significant parameter in the removal efficiency model, represented a positive correlation with this response in most parts of the operating region. The optimal point with the highest desirability (i.e., D<inf>1</inf> point) was obtained at the inlet HCHO concentration of 120 ppm, inlet ozone concentration of 40 ppm, and reaction time of 11.35 s within the parameter ranges studied, resulting in 64% removal efficiency and 2.64 g/kWh energy yield. At the point with the second highest desirability (D<inf>2</inf>), 100% removal efficiency along with 0.7 g/kWh energy yield was achieved indicating the very good performance of the process. The indirect plasma approach used in this study presented a successful performance in terms of removal efficiency along with acceptable energy yield compared to other plasma-assisted processes reported in the literature. The results suggested that ozone-assisted indirect plasma treatment can be utilized as an efficient alternative method for formaldehyde removal in commercial kitchens, while efficiency or energy yield should be prioritized for optimizing operating conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cold Plasma; Commercial Cooking Air Pollutants; Formaldehyde Emission; Indirect Plasma Treatment; Response Surface Methodology; Volatile Organic Compound (voc) Removal; Atmospheric Pollution; Formaldehyde; Optimization; Ozone; Plasma; Response Surface Methodology; Volatile Organic Compound","atmospheric pollution; formaldehyde; optimization; ozone; plasma; response surface methodology; volatile organic compound","","","","Sofuoglu, Sait C., Indoor air quality in a restaurant kitchen using margarine for deep-frying, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 22, 20, pp. 15703-15711, (2015); Gao, Xiangjing, Characteristics and risk assessment of occupational exposure to ultrafine particles generated from cooking in the Chinese restaurant, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Li, Jing, Synergetic effect of N/P/B coordinated Fe/Co on carbon support catalysts for removing odor-chemicals of cooking source, SN Applied Sciences, 2, 12, (2020); Ma, Yongsheng, In vivo respiratory toxicology of cooking oil fumes: Evidence, mechanisms and prevention, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 402, (2021); Zhang, Xiaofang, Meta-analysis of associations between cooking oil fumes exposure and lung cancer risk, Indoor and Built Environment, 31, 3, pp. 820-837, (2022); Wang, Lina, Role of Chinese cooking emissions on ambient air quality and human health, Science of the Total Environment, 589, pp. 173-181, (2017); Zhao, Dongfang, Cooking grease particles purification review and technology combination strategy evaluation for commercial kitchens, Building Simulation, 14, 6, pp. 1597-1617, (2021); Ho, Yu An, Moderate-temperature catalytic incineration of cooking oil fumes using hydrophobic honeycomb supported Pt/CNT catalyst, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 379, (2019); Zhao, Jingjing, Health risk assessment of formaldehyde released from several Chinese dishes cooking activities, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 371, 3, (2019); Höllbacher, Eva, Emissions of indoor air pollutants from six user scenarios in a model room, Atmospheric Environment, 150, pp. 389-394, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","2052336X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165547638"

However, developing field-based methods to monitor ammonia emissions in complex and fluctuating environments has always been a significant challenge, hindering the establishment of an accurate ammonia emission profile, necessary for decision-makers to tailor solutions to guide sustainable agricultural practices. This review thus systematically summarizes recent advancements in ammonia emission monitoring technologies for livestock and poultry breeding sources, encompassing three self-classified techniques, namely chemical instrument-based, spectroscopy-based, and sensor-based methods. The review also provides a comparative analysis and discussion of their technical principles, technical characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, accuracy, detection range and response time, etc.), application scenarios, and scopes. Furthermore, this work introduces microfluidics and membrane technologies that can subtly be integrated with sensor-based technology to address gaps in existing monitoring technologies, elaborating their feasibility and application potential in detail for monitoring ammonia emissions from livestock and poultry breeding sources. These insights illuminate future trends in the development of field-based, real-time ammonia emissions monitoring technology for sustainable agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonia Emissions; Livestock And Poultry Breeding; Monitoring Technology; Sensors; Sustainable Agriculture; Agriculture; Decision Making; Membrane Technology; Ammonia Emissions; Cutting Edges; Emission Profile; Emissions Monitoring; Environmental Issues; Livestock And Poultry Breeding; Monitoring Technologies; State Of The Art; Sustainable Agriculture; Total Emissions; Ammonia","Agriculture; Decision making; Membrane technology; Ammonia emissions; Cutting edges; Emission profile; Emissions monitoring; Environmental issues; Livestock and poultry breeding; Monitoring technologies; State of the art; Sustainable agriculture; Total emissions; Ammonia","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21806080 ); and the Australian Research Council Industry Fellowship Grant ( IE230100593 ).","AbuDalo, Muna Ahmed, Ion imprinted polymer based electrochemical sensor for environmental monitoring of copper(II), International Journal of Electrochemical Science, 10, 8, pp. 6780-6793, (2015); Athavale, Rohini, In Situ Ammonium Profiling Using Solid-Contact Ion-Selective Electrodes in Eutrophic Lakes, Analytical Chemistry, 87, 24, pp. 11990-11997, (2015); Azzouz, Imadeddine, Zinc oxide nano-enabled microfluidic reactor for water purification and its applicability to volatile organic compounds, Microsystems and Nanoengineering, 4, (2018); Berthomieu, Catherine, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Photosynthesis Research, 101, 2-3, pp. 157-170, (2009); Beusen, Arthur HW, Bottom-up uncertainty estimates of global ammonia emissions from global agricultural production systems, Atmospheric Environment, 42, 24, pp. 6067-6077, (2008); Bhattarai, Noshan, Sources of gaseous NH3 in urban Beijing from parallel sampling of NH3 and NH4+, their nitrogen isotope measurement and modeling, Science of the Total Environment, 747, (2020); Bjorneberg, David L., Measurement of atmospheric ammonia, methane, and nitrous oxide at a concentrated dairy production facility in southern idaho using open-path FTIR spectrometry, Transactions of the ASABE, 52, 5, pp. 1749-1756, (2009); Bowden, Michaela, The determination of phosphorus in a microfluidic manifold demonstrating long-term reagent lifetime and chemical stability utilising a colorimetric method, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 90, 1-3, pp. 170-174, (2003); Brownson, Dale A.C., Graphene electrochemistry: Fundamental concepts through to prominent applications, Chemical Society Reviews, 41, 21, pp. 6944-6976, (2012); Caplin, Jeremy D., Microfluidic Organ-on-a-Chip Technology for Advancement of Drug Development and Toxicology, Advanced Healthcare Materials, 4, 10, pp. 1426-1450, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174804193"

Catalytic combustion is the most popular technology used for the removal of VOCs as it can be adapted to different organic emissions under mild conditions. This review first introduces the hazards of VOCs, their treatment technologies, and summarizes the treatment mechanism issues. Next, the characteristics and catalytic performance of perovskite oxides as catalysts for VOC removal are expounded, with a special focus on lattice distortions and surface defects caused by metal doping and surface modifications, and on the treatment of different VOCs. The challenges and the prospects regarding the design of perovskite oxides catalysts for the catalytic combustion of VOCs are also discussed.

Herein, the mesoporous carbon with atomic Fe-N<inf>4</inf> sites embedded in the ordered carbon nanochannels (Fe-N<inf>4</inf>/CMK-3) was synthesized by the hard-template method. Fe-N<inf>4</inf>/CMK-3 can be employed as nanoreactors with preferred electronic and geometric catalytic microenvironments for the internal catalytic ozonation of CH<inf>3</inf>SH. During the CH<inf>3</inf>SH oxidation process, the mass transfer coefficient of the Fe-N<inf>4</inf>/CMK-3 confined system with sufficient O<inf>3</inf> transfer featured a level of at least 1.87 × 10-5, which is 34.6 times that of the Fe-N<inf>4</inf>/C-Si unconfined system. Detailed experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the anchored atomic Fe-N<inf>4</inf> sites and nanoconfinement effects regulated the local electronic structure of the catalyst and promoted the activation of O<inf>3</inf> molecules to produce atomic oxygen species (AOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), eventually achieving efficient oxidation of CH<inf>3</inf>SH into CO<inf>2</inf>/SO<inf>4</inf>2-. Benefiting from the high diffusion rate and the augmentation of AOS/ROS, Fe-N<inf>4</inf>/CMK-3 exhibited an excellent poisoning tolerance, along with high catalytic durability. This contribution provides the proof-of-concept strategy for accelerating catalytic ozonation of sulfur-containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by combining confined catalysis and atomic catalysts and can be extended to the purification of other gaseous pollutants. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation;

Herein, a hollow carbon polyhedron with nitrogen-coordinated cobalt embedded has been synthesized by thermal transformation of the core–shell structure ZIF-8@ZIF-67 (marked as ZIF-8@ZIF-67-C). Remarkably, the ZIF-8@ZIF-67-C catalyst could remove almost 98% of CH<inf>3</inf>SH after running for 60 min, exceeding the reported values (about 30 times higher than that of commercial MnO<inf>2</inf> catalysts). Elimination performance experimental results demonstrate that ZIF-8@ZIF-67-C has better anti-interference ability and anti-toxicity properties. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the following facts: unique structure, high conductivity, abundant hierarchical porous structure, and accessible active sites. Theoretical calculation reveals the mechanism is that the Co-N electron bridge promotes Co nanoparticles adsorb O<inf>3</inf>, providing electrons to O<inf>3</inf> and producing 1O<inf>2</inf> to further oxidize CH<inf>3</inf>SH into CO<inf>2</inf>/SO<inf>4</inf>2−. Also, the ZIF-8@ZIF-67-C catalyst supported on Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> still shows excellent catalytic activity and durability, which deepened the practical application.

In biofiltration for VOC removal, the performance could be affected by several design and operating factors, and there are some prevailing problems which need overcoming. In this article, the state of the art and development trends of biofiltration for VOC removal were comprehensively reviewed and commented on. First of all, the factors affecting the removal performance of VOCs by biofiltration were reviewed and presented which include the properties of VOCs and design and operating parameters of biofilters. Then, the prevailing problems in biofilters were summarized and discussed, such as the uneven distributions of biomass and VOC loads as well as nutrients, unsatisfactory removal for VOCs at high organic loads and with hydrophobility, and inconsistent interactions among multicomponent VOCs. At last, the corresponding solutions for the problems were proposed and commented on.

The maximum amplitude and pulse width of the output voltage of the pulse generator without load are 10 kV and 31 ns, respectively, and the maximum energy transfer efficiency reaches 88% with a load resistance of 0.44 kω. This pulse generator was applied to multilayered wires-to-wires electrodes, and the streamer discharges propagated between the electrodes were observed. Streamers initially propagate horizontally according to the Laplacian electric field near the high-voltage electrode. When they approach the ground electrodes, they curve and propagate toward the ground electrode due to the high electric field between the streamer head and the ground electrode. The velocity of the streamer propagation is with a velocity of 0.4 to 0.71 × 106 m s-1. Ozone production and ethylene removal characteristics are investigated in a sealed vessel.

In this experimental study, chemical representatives of different VOC groups were subjected to deep catalytic oxidation on a pilot scale. State-of-the-art monolithic and spherical pelletized commercially available catalysts containing precious metals (Pt, Pd) as the active compounds were used. Experimental conditions (gas flow, high loads of VOC, and real flue gas mixture) were as close as possible to the real full-scale applications. For each catalyst and the tested VOC, a light-off curve was obtained and T<inf>50</inf> and T<inf>90</inf> values (temperatures corresponding to 50% and 90% conversions) were calculated. T<inf>50</inf> and T<inf>90</inf> values obtained in this pilot-scale study were compared with other laboratory-scale studies outcomes. T<inf>50</inf> values are not significantly different; however, T<inf>90</inf> are higher for the pilot scale. The interesting aspect of this comparison is to see if newly developed catalysts have better performance than already adopted and used commercial samples of VOC oxidation catalysts.

However, microporous activated carbon-based adsorbents and catalyst supports have the disadvantage of difficult molecule diffusion. Herein, we have demonstrated that porous graphitized carbon (PGC) allowed faster intra-particle diffusion of organic molecules due to its well-developed mesoporous structure. Therefore, a wet scrubbing system containing H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and a PGC-supported FeOCl catalyst has been developed to effectively remove gaseous dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene. The scrubber performed well at pH 3.0 using a FeOCl/PGC dosage of 0.2 g/L and initial H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentration of 40 mM. Its good long-term performance was achieved by replenishing H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to maintain a suitable concentration.

The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, low-temperature N<inf>2</inf>-adsorption, and CO chemisorption. The tests on complete catalytic oxidation of different VOC (propane, butane, hexane, dimethyl ether, toluene, propylene) and CO were carried out. The reaction kinetics and the mechanism of the reaction of complete oxidation of toluene are being investigated in detail. The results show that the new catalyst design makes it able to completely oxidize the studied VOCs and CO at low temperatures (100–350 °C) with long-term stability. Using a variety of instrumental methods, it was established that for high activity and long-term stability, the optimal ratio Pd/PdO should be close to 1:1. The most probable mechanism of complete toluene oxidation is the mechanism of Langmuir–Hinshelwood.

Microfluidic technology used small volumes of fluids in the microscale channels and chambers. It has the potential to provide high throughput assays as well as manipulate organ-on-chips models to simulate the complex interaction of organs in the body. Scope and approach: This review discusses the progress and limitation of psychophysics, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate odor-induced taste perception. The application of organ-on-chip models of the nasal mucosa, oral cavity, and brain-gut axis with microfluidics is also discussed. Key finding and conclusions: Sensory results showed congruency between taste and odor affected the extent to which odor enhances taste perception. EEG and fMRI demonstrated the cross-modal interactions occur within primary sensory cortices in the brain, but the previous learning and experience are equally important. The multi-channel on the microfluidics not only provides an advantage to separate macromolecules in the sample matrix but can also offer higher throughput than conventional item-by-item detection and decreases reagents and sample consumption. It is feasible to establish in vitro sensory models to investigate interactions among flavor components with olfactory/taste receptors, brain, gut, etc. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Food Flavor; Gut-brain-axis; Microfluidics; Olfactory; Sensory; Taste; Brain; Electrophysiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Microfluidics; Odors; Chip Models; Food Flavors; Gut-brain-axis; Microfluidic Techniques; Molecular Levels; Olfactory; On Chips; Sensory; Taste; Taste Perceptions; Electroencephalography","Brain; Electrophysiology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Microfluidics; Odors; Chip models; Food flavors; Gut-brain-axis; Microfluidic techniques; Molecular levels; Olfactory; On chips; Sensory; Taste; Taste perceptions; Electroencephalography","","","This study was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 32272452, and No. 30190186).

In this study, a process was developed to remove an odorous VOC using a combined non-thermal plasma (NTP) and wet scrubber (WS) system. The low removal efficiency of WSs and the large amount of ozone generated by NTP were resolved. Compared to the decomposition effects when using a WS and NTP separately, the NTP + WS system improved the removal efficiency of ethyl acrylate (EA) and significantly reduced ozone emissions. The maximum EA removal efficiency was 99.9%. Additionally, an EA removal efficiency of over 53.4% and a 100% ozone removal efficiency were achieved even at discharge voltages lower than 4.5 kV. Ozone catalysis was confirmed to occur in the NTP + WS system. Furthermore, we verified the removal of by-products such as residual ozone and formaldehyde, which is a representative organic intermediate of EA. This study demonstrates that the NTP + WS system is a green technology for removing odorous VOCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethyl Acrylate; Hydroxyl Radical; Non-thermal Plasma; Ozone Emission; Volatile Organic Compound; Wet Scrubber; Acrylic Acid Ethyl Ester; Formaldehyde; Hydroxyl Radical; Ozone; Air Pollutants; Ozone; Plasma Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds; Efficiency; Electric Discharges; Ozone; Scrubbers; Ethyl Acrylates; Human Health; Hydroxyl Radicals; Low Removal Efficiencies; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Emission; Quality Of Life; Scrubber Systems; Wet Scrubbers; Volatile Organic Compounds; Acrylic Acid Ethyl Ester; Formaldehyde; Hydroxyl Radical; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compound; Fragrance; Catalysis; Plasma; Quality Of Life; Article; Chemical Bond; Chemical Reaction; Comparative Study; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Decomposition; Dissolution; Electric Field; Electric Potential; Flow Rate; Gas Chromatography; Oxidation; Plasma Gas; Synergistic Effect; Waste Component Removal; Water Solubility; Air Pollutant; Human; Prevention And Control; Air Pollutants; Humans; Odorants; Plasma Gases; Quality Of Life; Volatile Organic Compounds","Efficiency; Electric discharges; Ozone; Scrubbers; Ethyl acrylates; Human health; Hydroxyl radicals; Low removal efficiencies; Nonthermal plasma; Ozone emission; Quality of life; Scrubber systems; Wet scrubbers; Volatile organic compounds; acrylic acid ethyl ester; formaldehyde; hydroxyl radical; ozone; volatile organic compound; fragrance; catalysis; plasma; quality of life; Article; chemical bond; chemical reaction; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; decomposition; dissolution; electric field; electric potential; flow rate; gas chromatography; oxidation; plasma gas; synergistic effect; waste component removal; water solubility; air pollutant; human; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Humans; Odorants; Plasma Gases; Quality of Life; Volatile Organic Compounds","","acrylic acid ethyl ester, 140-88-5; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; hydroxyl radical, 3352-57-6; ozone, 10028-15-6; Air Pollutants; Ozone; Plasma Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds","This study was conducted with the support of the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology as part of the project “Development of eco-friendly production system technology for total periodic resource cycle ( KITECH EO-22-0007 )”.","Alinezhad, Ebrahim, Technical and economic investigation of chemical scrubber and bio-filtration in removal of H2S and NH3 from wastewater treatment plant, Journal of Environmental Management, 241, pp. 32-43, (2019); Andreozzi, Laura, Rheological and thermal properties of narrow distribution poly(ethyl acrylate)s, Macromolecules, 39, 5, pp. 1880-1889, (2006); Asilevi, Prince Junior, Indoor air quality improvement and purification by atmospheric pressure Non-Thermal Plasma (NTP), Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Bernard, François, Kinetics and products of gas-phase reactions of ozone with methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, and ethyl acrylate, Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 114, 32, pp. 8376-8383, (2010); Biard, Pierre François, Intensification of volatile organic compound absorption in a compact wet scrubber at co-current flow, Chemosphere, 173, pp. 612-621, (2017); Biswas, Mriganka Sekhar, Simultaneous observations of nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and ozone in the indo-gangetic plain, Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 19, 8, pp. 1749-1764, (2019); Bubacz, Kamila, Investigation of OH radicals formation on the surface of TiO2/N photocatalyst at the presence of terephthalic acid solution.

Different remediation materials have been developed to deal with the environmental problems caused by CHs. Remediation materials can be classified into three main categories according to the corresponding technologies: adsorption materials, chemical reduction materials and bioaugmentation materials. In this paper, the classification and preparation of the three materials are briefly described in terms of synthesis and properties according to the different types. Then, a detailed review of the remediation mechanisms and applications of the different materials in soil and groundwater remediation is presented in relation to the various properties of the materials and the different challenges encountered in laboratory research or in the environmental application. The removal trends in different environments were found to be largely similar, which means that composite materials tend to be more effective in removing CHs in actual remediation. For instance, adsorbents were found to be effective when combined with other materials, due to the ability to take advantage of the respective strengths of both materials. The rapid removal of CHs while minimizing the impact of CHs on another material and the material itself on the environment.

This study examined bioaerosol emission, odour removal, pollutant transformation mechanism, and project investment. At an inlet flow rate of 7200 m3/h, the average removal efficiencies of hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf>S), ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the steady stage were 97.2 %, 98.9 %, and 92.2 %. The BTF-FBF separates microbial phases (bacteria and fungi) of different modules. BTF removed most hydrophilic compounds, while FBF removed hydrophobic ones. Moreover, the reactor could effectively remove pathogens or opportunistic pathogens bioaerosols, such as Escherichia coli (61.9%), Salmonella sp. (85%), and Aspergillus fumigatus (82.1%). The pollutant transformation mechanism of BTF-FBF was proposed. BTF-FBF annualized costs were 324,783 CNY/year at 15 years.

This study aimed to reveal the odorants, hazardous pollutants, and greenhouse gas emission characteristics of the flare exhaust. Odorants, hazardous pollutants, and greenhouse gases emitted from air-assisted flares and a diffusion flare were analyzed, the priority monitoring pollutants were identified, and the combustion and odorant removal efficiencies of the flares were estimated. The concentrations of most odorants and the sum of odor activity values decreased significantly after combustion, but the odor concentration could still exceed 2,000. The odorants in the flare exhaust were dominated by oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), while the major odor contributors were OVOCs and sulfur compounds. Hazardous pollutants, including carcinogens, acute toxic pollutants, endocrine disrupting chemicals, and ozone precursors with the total ozone formation potential up to 75 ppm<inf>v</inf>, as well as greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide with maximum concentrations of 4,000 and 1.9 ppm<inf>v</inf>, respectively) were emitted from the flares. Additionally, secondary pollutants, such as acetaldehyde and benzene, were formed during combustion. The combustion performance of the flares varied with landfill gas composition and flare design. The combustion and pollutant removal efficiencies could be lower than 90%, especially for the diffusion flare. Acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, p-cymene, limonene, hydrogen sulfide, and methane could be priority monitoring pollutants for flare emissions in landfills. Flares are useful for odor and greenhouse gas control in landfills, but they are also potential sources of odor, hazardous pollutants, and greenhouse gases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flare;

In this work, the intermediate products in the process of eliminating various VOCs by different catalytic technologies are systematically reviewed. Based on intermediates analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of various catalytic technologies in the control of by-products are described in detail. The paper also focuses on the detection techniques of characteristic intermediates in VOCs elimination, and discusses the characterization methods and their usage conditions.

To overcome these issues, this paper discusses the degradation of chlorobenzene (CB) in systems of NTP coupled with catalysts, and the influence of catalyst locations in the NTP was investigated. In addition, the interaction between plasma and catalyst was also explored. The results indicated that the degradability of CB was remarkably improved through the combination of NTP with catalysts, and the formation of ozone was effectively inhibited. The degradation efficiency increased from 33.9% to 79.6% at 14 kV in the NTP-catalytic system, while the ozone concentration decreased from 437 to 237 mg m−3, and the degradation efficiency of in plasma catalysis (IPC) systems was superior to that of the post plasma catalysis system, while the inhibition ability of ozone exhibited an opposing trend. In the IPC system, the degradation efficiency was 87.7% at 14 kV, while the ozone concentration was 151 mg m−3. Besides, the plasma did not destroy the pore structure and crystal structure of the catalyst, but affected the surface morphology and redox performance of the catalyst. Thus, NTP coupled catalytic system could improve the degradation performance of CB. Furthermore, the plasma discharge characteristics played a major role in the NTP synergistic catalytic degradation of CB. Finally, based on the experiment analysis results, the general reaction mechanism of CB degradation in an IPC reaction system was proposed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysts; Chlorobenzene; Decomposition Mechanism; Non-thermal Plasma; Ozone; Catalysis; Catalysts; Crystal Structure; Decomposition; Degradation; Efficiency; Electric Discharges; Morphology; Pore Structure; Surface Morphology; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic System; Chlorobenzene; Decomposition Mechanism; Degradation Efficiency; Its Applications; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Concentration; Performance; Plasma Catalysis; ]+ Catalyst; Ozone","Catalysis; Catalysts; Crystal structure; Decomposition; Degradation; Efficiency; Electric discharges; Morphology; Pore structure; Surface morphology; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic system; Chlorobenzene; Decomposition mechanism; Degradation efficiency; ITS applications; Nonthermal plasma; Ozone concentration; Performance; Plasma catalysis; ]+ catalyst; Ozone","","","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFC1903100), Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project Program (No. Z191100009119002) and the State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Odor Pollution Control (No. 20210504).","Lyu, Xiaopu, Hazardous volatile organic compounds in ambient air of China, Chemosphere, 246, (2020); Liu, Biyuan, Catalytic ozonation of VOCs at low temperature: A comprehensive review, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 422, (2022); Chang, Tian, Mn-Based Catalysts for Post Non-Thermal Plasma Catalytic Abatement of VOCs: A Review on Experiments, Simulations and Modeling, Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 41, 5, pp. 1239-1278, (2021); Lin, Fawei, How to achieve complete elimination of Cl-VOCs: A critical review on byproducts formation and inhibition strategies during catalytic oxidation, Chemical Engineering Journal, 404, (2021); Zhang, Shihan, Current advances of VOCs degradation by bioelectrochemical systems: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 334, pp. 2625-2637, (2018); Qian, Yu, Effects of four chlorobenzenes on serum sex steroids and hepatic microsome enzyme activities in crucian carp, Carassius auratus, Chemosphere, 57, 2, pp. 127-133, (2004); Jin, Xingpeng, Chlorobenzene removal using dbd coupled with cuo/γ-al2 o3 catalyst, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 14, (2021); Hu, Yaxin, Adsorption kinetics of gaseous chlorobenzene on electrospun lignin-based nanofiber, Journal of Materials Science, 57, 2, pp. 1536-1544, (2022); Liang, Wenjun, Catalytic combustion of chlorobenzene at low temperature over Ru-Ce/TiO2: High activity and high selectivity, Applied Catalysis A: General, 623, (2021); Li, Bo, Efficient combustion of chlorinated volatile organic compounds driven by natural sunlight, Science of the Total Environment, 749, (2020)","","Institute of Physics","","","","","","10090630","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148951556"

This study developed catalysts containing abundant Ce[sbnd]O[sbnd]Cu bonds anchored on titanium nanotubes (TNTs) to form strong electronic metal–metal interaction (EMMI) coordination structure for efficiently catalytic ozonation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). The occurrence of EMMI resulted in the formation of electron-poor/rich centers and a high proportion of weak-acidity sites over Ce-Cu/TNTs catalysts. Among various catalysts, 1Ce1Cu/TNTs exhibited the optimum catalytic performance with 92.5 % of 1,2-DCE conversion and 85.4 % of CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity, the long-term stability of 24 h and the good water resistance to 50 % relative humidity (RH). Importantly, the XPS results and DFT calculations suggested Ce drove the Cl atom off Cu species, thus alleviating the chloridion deposit on Cu sites, accelerating the migration of chlorine and offering more redox sites for O<inf>3</inf> activation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching tests identified that •OH was a key reactive oxygen species to achieve efficient degradation of 1,2-DCE. The possible reaction pathways for the catalytic ozonation of 1,2-DCE included three parts, including O<inf>3</inf> activation, 1,2-DCE preliminary degradation and deep oxidation, which obeyed the L-H mechanism. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1,2-dichloroethane; Catalytic Ozonation; Ce Doping; Chlorine Resistance; Electronic Metal–metal Interaction; Catalyst Activity; Catalyst Selectivity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cerium; Cerium Compounds; Chlorine; Copper; Copper Compounds; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Ozone; Ozonization; Paramagnetic Resonance; Volatile Organic Compounds; 1,2-dichloroethane; Catalytic Ozonation; Ce-doping; Chlorine Resistances; Dichloroethane; Electronic Metal–metal Interaction; Metal-metal Interactions; Temperature Performance; Titania Nanotubes; ]+ Catalyst; Chemical Activation","Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Chlorine; Copper; Copper compounds; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Ozone; Ozonization; Paramagnetic resonance; Volatile organic compounds; 1,2-dichloroethane; Catalytic ozonation; Ce-doping; Chlorine resistances; Dichloroethane; Electronic metal–metal interaction; Metal-metal interactions; Temperature performance; Titania nanotubes; ]+ catalyst; Chemical activation","","","The authors express their appreciation for financial support obtained from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFC1807902 ).","Zhang, Hao, Catalytic combustion of CVOCs over MoOx/CeO2 catalysts, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 310, (2022); Hutchings, Graham John, Uranium-oxide-based catalysts for the destruction of volatile chloro- organic compounds, Nature, 384, 6607, pp. 341-343, (1996); Shing, Tet Leong, Applicability of gasoline containing ethanol as Thailand's alternative fuel to curb toxic VOC pollutants from automobile emission, Atmospheric Environment, 36, 21, pp. 3495-3503, (2002); Guo, Yunlong, Recent advances in VOC elimination by catalytic oxidation technology onto various nanoparticles catalysts: a critical review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 281, (2021); Li, Chunli, A review on recent advances in catalytic combustion of chlorinated volatile organic compounds, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 95, 8, pp. 2069-2082, (2020); Liu, Biyuan, Catalytic ozonation of VOCs at low temperature: A comprehensive review, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 422, (2022); Cui, Jiahao, Catalytic ozonation of volatile organic compounds (ethyl acetate) at normal temperature, Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering, 32, pp. 159-167, (2021); Feng, Chao, Defect engineering technique for the fabrication of LaCoO3 perovskite catalyst via urea treatment for total oxidation of propane, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 304, (2022); Lin, Fawei, Efficient degradation of multiple Cl-VOCs by catalytic ozonation over MnOx catalysts with different supports, Chemical Engineering Journal, 435, (2022); Zhang, Qifeng, Vinyl chloride catalytic combustion on Pt/CeO2: Tuning Pt chemical state to promote Cl removing, Chemosphere, 307, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18733794; 13835866","","SPUTF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146867671"

Asphalt pavements are flat and seamless, making it comfortable for driving and convenient to maintain. As such, it is a popular preference among the various road pavement types. However, asphalt materials typically release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the surrounding environment during construction. These compounds seriously affect air quality and endanger human health. Further research on VOC release characteristics and suppression strategies with respect to asphalt materials is one of the important steps toward adopting and developing green transportation. At present, research has been conducted regarding the aspects of characterization methods, component characteristics, influencing factors, and suppression strategies. The research results show that there is no universal standard for characterizing VOCs emitted by asphalt, making it difficult to compare and analyze results. Furthermore, the composition characteristics and influencing factors of VOCs are not related to the internal properties of asphalt materials. Moreover, the development of suppression lacks theoretical guidance, which leads to low suppression efficiency and poor performance of asphalt. Accordingly, this paper summarizes the status of research conducted domestically and abroad on VOCs release characteristics and suppression strategies with regard to asphalt materials. The characterization methods, component characteristics, influencing factors, and suppression strategies are introduced. The existing problems and prospects future research are also analyzed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asphalt; Characterization Method; Component; Road Engineering; Suppression Strategy; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Quality; Asphalt; Materials Handling; Asphalt Materials; Buildings Materials; Characterization Methods; Component; Component Characteristics; Construction Applications; Method Components; Release Characteristics; Road Engineering; Suppression Strategy; Volatile Organic Compounds","Air quality; Asphalt; Materials handling; Asphalt materials; Buildings materials; Characterization methods; Component; Component characteristics; Construction applications; Method components; Release characteristics; Road engineering; Suppression strategy; Volatile organic compounds","","","　 This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51808073),Chongqing Jiaotong University Graduate Research Innovation Project (2022S0015),and Materials Engineering Chongqing Postgraduate Joint Training Base (201907).","China Highway; McCarthy, Bernard M., Comparison of Field- and Laboratory-Generated Asphalt Fumes, Transportation Research Record, 1661, pp. 54-59, (1999); Liang, Xiaoming, Volatile Organic Compounds(VOCs)Emission Inventory from Domestic Sources in China, Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science, 42, 11, pp. 5162-5168, (2021); Cui, Peng, VOC emissions from asphalt pavement and health risks to construction workers, Journal of Cleaner Production, 244, (2020); Chong, Dan, Volatile organic compounds generated in asphalt pavement construction and their health effects on workers, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 140, 2, (2014); Binet, Stéphane, Bitumen fumes: Review of work on the potential risk to workers and the present knowledge on its origin, Science of the Total Environment, 300, 1-3, pp. 37-49, (2002); Li, Tingting, Emission characteristics and health risk assessment of VOCs from asphalt pavement construction, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science, 41, 1, pp. 73-80, (2021); Meng, Xianlin, Health risk assessment of air pollutants for some coal resource-based city, Harbin Gongye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology, 44, 6, pp. 41-44, (2012); Wang, Tao, Ozone pollution in China: A review of concentrations, meteorological influences, chemical precursors, and effects, Science of the Total Environment, 575, pp. 1582-1596, (2017); Amann, Markus Christian, The revision of the air quality legislation in the European Union related to ground-level ozone, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 78, 1-3, pp. 41-62, (2000)","","Cailiao Daobaoshe/ Materials Review","","","","","","1005023X","","","","Chinese","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151744606"

This review discusses the emission characteristics, which are influenced by different cooking temperatures, cooking oils, and cuisines. Then, various cooking oil fume purification methods are mainly classified into physical capture, chemical decomposition, and combination methods. VOCs removal rate, system operability, secondary pollution, application area, and cost are compared. The catalytic combustion method was found to have the advantages of high VOC removal efficiency, environmental protection, and low cost. Therefore, the last part of this review focuses on the research progress of the catalytic combustion method and summarizes its mechanisms and catalysts. The Marse-van Krevelen (MVK), Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H), and Eley-Rideal (E-R) mechanisms are analyzed. Noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts are commonly used. The former showed excellent activity at low temperatures due to its strong adsorption and electron transfer abilities, but the high price limits its application. The transition metals primarily comprise the latter, including single metal and composite metal catalysts. Compared to single metal catalysts, the interaction between metals in composite metal catalysts can further enhance the catalytic performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Combustion; Cooking Oil Fume; Emission Characteristics; Purification Methods; Vocs; Catalysis; Catalysts; Combustion; Oils And Fats; Precious Metals; Purification; Catalytic Combustion; Catalytic Combustion Method; Characteristic Method; Cooking Oil Fume; Cooking Temperatures; Emission Characteristics; Human Health; Metal Catalyst; Purification Method; Volatile Organic Compound Removals; Volatile Organic Compounds","Catalysis; Catalysts; Combustion; Oils and fats; Precious metals; Purification; Catalytic combustion; Catalytic combustion method; Characteristic method; Cooking oil fume; Cooking temperatures; Emission characteristics; Human health; Metal catalyst; Purification method; Volatile organic compound removals; Volatile organic compounds","","","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52106149 and 51976074).","Chen, Tzuyu, Impact of cooking oil fume exposure and fume extractor use on lung cancer risk in non-smoking Han Chinese women, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Hung, Huey Shan, Association of cooking oil fumes exposure with lung cancer: Involvement of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins in cell survival and proliferation in vitro, Mutation Research - Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis, 628, 2, pp. 107-116, (2007); Chang, Stephen S., Chemical reactions involved in the deep-fat frying of foods1, JAOCS, Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, 55, 10, pp. 718-727, (1978); He, Zhuoran, Contributions of different anthropogenic volatile organic compound sources to ozone formation at a receptor site in the Pearl River Delta region and its policy implications, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 19, 13, pp. 8801-8816, (2019); Yin, Zhihua, Polymorphisms in pre-miRNA genes and cooking oil fume exposure as well as their interaction on the risk of lung cancer in a Chinese nonsmoking female population, OncoTargets and Therapy, 9, pp. 395-401, (2016); Huang, Binbin, Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) in environment - sources, potential human health impacts, and current remediation technologies, Environment International, 71, pp. 118-138, (2014); Huang, Yu Sing, Characteristics and health impacts of VOCs and carbonyls associated with residential cooking activities in Hong Kong, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 186, 1, pp. 344-351, (2011); Song, Sang-Keun, Source apportionment of VOCs and their impact on air quality and health in the megacity of Seoul, Environmental Pollution, 247, pp. 763-774, (2019); Kampa, Marilena, Human health effects of air pollution, Environmental Pollution, 151, 2, pp. 362-367, (2008); Pöschl, Ulrich J., Atmospheric aerosols: Composition, transformation, climate and health effects, Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 44, 46, pp. 7520-7540, (2005)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22279717","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151627157"

The combined effect of parameters such as temperature (20–400 °C) and plasma power (10–40 W) was investigated to evaluate the DBD reactor performance. The main gaseous products from the decomposition of toluene include lower hydrocarbon (C<inf>1</inf>–C<inf>6</inf>). The cracking of toluene increases with power at all temperatures (20–400 °C). On the otherhand, it decreases from 92.8 to 73.1% at 10 W, 97.2 to 80.5% at 20, 97.5 to 86.5% at 30 W, and 98.4 to 93.7% at 40 W with raising the temperature from 20 to 400 °C. Nonetheless, as the temperature and plasma input power increase, the methane yield increases. At 40 W, the maximum methane yield was 5.1%. At 10 and 20 W, the selectivity to C<inf>2</inf> increases as the temperature rises up to 400 °C. At 30 and 40 W, it began to drop after 300 °C due to the formation of methane and the yield of methane increases significantly beyond this temperature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass Gasification; Lower Hydrocarbons; Non-thermal Plasma; Tar Removal","","","","","Basu, Prabir, Biomass gasification and pyrolysis: Practical design and theory, pp. 1-365, (2010); Narváez, Ian, Biomass gasification with air in an atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed.

To enhance DMAC-facilitated n-hexane removal, we investigated the simultaneous removal of multiple pollutants in a rotating drum biofilter packed with bamboo charcoal-polyurethane composite. After adding 800 mg·L−1 DMAC, the n-hexane removal efficiency increased from 59.4 % to 83.1 % under the optimized conditions. The maximum elimination capacity of 10.0 g·m−3·h−1 n-hexane and 157 g·m−3·h−1 DMAC were obtained. The biomass of bamboo charcoal-polyurethane and the ratio of protein-to-polysaccharide in extracellular polymeric substances were significantly increased compared with the non-DMAC stage, which is attributed to increased carbon utilization. In addition, Na+ K+-ATPase was positively correlated with increasing electron transport system activity, which was 1.98 and 1.36 times greater. Hydrophilic DMAC improved the bioavailability of hydrophobic n-hexane and benefited bacterial metabolism.

Nonthermal plasma (NTP) as an alternative to traditional methods has been employed to degrade VOC in the atmosphere and wastewater for its high removal efficiency (up to 100%), mild operating conditions, and environmental friendliness. This review outlined the principles of NTP production and the applications on VOC removal in different kinds of reactors, like single/double dielectric barrier discharge, surface discharge, and gliding arc discharge reactors. The combination of NTP with catalysts/oxidants was also applied for VOC degradation to further promote the energy efficiency. Further, detailed explanations were given of the effect of various important factors including input/reactor/external conditions on VOC degradation performance. The reactive species (e.g., high-energy electrons, HO·, O·, N<inf>2</inf>+, Ar+, O<inf>3</inf>, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) generated in NTP discharge process have played crucial roles in decomposing VOC molecules; therefore, their variation under different parameter conditions along with the reaction mechanisms involved in these NTP technologies was emphatically explained. Finally, a conclusion of the NTP technologies was presented, and special attention was paid to future challenges for NTP technologies in VOC treatment to stimulate the advances in this topic.

In this study, Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> was first optimized by loading MnO<inf>x</inf>. And then K was used for modifying MnO<inf>x</inf>/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst, which exhibited 2.4 × 10−3 mol∙g−1∙s−1 oxidation rate for dichloromethane and toluene oxidation with ca. 0.89 ppm ozone detected at 80 °C. That could be directly applied for removing toluene and dichloromethane mixture or coupled with other treatment technologies (such as biological purification). Besides, appropriate K doping could increase the amount of reactive surface oxygen species and the ratio of Mn2+, hence contributing to an enhanced oxidation ability. By contrast, an excess K doping inevitably lowered the activity of active surface oxygen species and interfered with the transformation of Mn3+ to Mn2+, which resulted in a weakened oxidative ability and thus a decreased catalytic activity. Finally, the reaction mechanisms over 0.1 K-MnO<inf>x</inf>/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> were tried to be demonstrated that the degradation of toluene mainly followed the pathway of toluene – phenylcarbinol – benzaldehyde – benzoic acid – phenyl group – small-molecule species and/or CO<inf>2</inf> while the route of dichloromethane – methanol – formaldehyde – formic acid – small-molecule species and/or CO<inf>2</inf> explained the catalytic oxidation of dichloromethane.

Firstly, the effect of key operating parameters such as EB concentration (13, 26, 60 mg/m3), relative humidity levels (From 5 to 80%), gas carrier composition (dry air + EB, O<inf>2</inf> + EB and N<inf>2</inf> + EB) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation wavelength (UV-A <inf>365 nm</inf>, UV-C <inf>254 nm</inf>) were explored. Then, using superoxide dismutase and tert-butanol as trapping agents, the real contribution of superoxide radical anion (O<inf>2</inf>.−) and hydroxyl radicals (OH.) to EB removal was quantified. The results show that (i) small water vapor content enhances the EB degradation; (ii) the reaction atmosphere plays an important role in the photocatalytic process; and (iii) oxygen atmosphere/UV-C radiation shows the highest EB degradation percentage. The use of radical scavengers confirms the major contribution of the hydroxyl radical to the photocatalytic mechanism with 75% versus 25% for superoxide radical anion. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethylbenzene; Hydroxyl Radical; Photocatalysis; Relative Humidity; Scavengers; Superoxide Radical Anion; Tio2; Ethylbenzene; Superoxide; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Ethylbenzene; Fiberglass; Gases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxides; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Anion; Catalyst; Hydroxyl Radical; Photodegradation; Reactive Oxygen Species; Relative Humidity; Water Vapor; Wavelength; Ethylbenzene; Glass Fiber; Nanoparticle; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Superoxide; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Catalysis; Gas; Ultraviolet Radiation; Catalysis; Gases; Nanoparticles; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxides; Titanium; Ultraviolet Rays","anion; catalyst; hydroxyl radical; photodegradation; reactive oxygen species; relative humidity; water vapor; wavelength; ethylbenzene; glass fiber; nanoparticle; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide; titanium; titanium dioxide; catalysis; gas; ultraviolet radiation; Catalysis; Gases; Nanoparticles; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxides; Titanium; Ultraviolet Rays","","ethylbenzene, 100-41-4; superoxide, 11062-77-4; titanium, 7440-32-6; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; ethylbenzene; fiberglass; Gases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxides; Titanium; titanium dioxide","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) for funding and supporting this work through Research Partnership Program no RP-21-09-66.; Funding text 2: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) for funding and supporting this work through Research Partnership Program no RP-21-09-66.","Abou Saoud, Wala, Abatement of ammonia and butyraldehyde under non-thermal plasma and photocatalysis: Oxidation processes for the removal of mixture pollutants at pilot scale, Chemical Engineering Journal, 344, pp. 165-172, (2018); Rismanchian, Masoud, Photocatalytic removal of gaseous toluene by titanium dioxide coated on nickel foam: Influence of relative humidity and toluene concentration, International Journal of Environmental Health Engineering, 3, 2, pp. 76-81, (2014); Saldanha, Larissa Albuquerque Silva, Photocatalytic ethylbenzene degradation associated with ozone (TiO2/UV/O3) under different percentages of catalytic coating area: Evaluation of process parameters, Separation and Purification Technology, 263, (2021); Altarawneh, Mohammednoor Khalil, Rate constants for reactions of ethylbenzene with hydroperoxyl radical, Combustion and Flame, 160, 1, pp. 9-16, (2013); Assadi, Aymen Amine, Modeling and simulation of VOCs removal by nonthermal plasma discharge with photocatalysis in a continuous reactor: Synergetic effect and mass transfer, Chemical Engineering Journal, 258, pp. 119-127, (2014); Assadi, Aymen Amine, Modeling of a continuous photocatalytic reactor for isovaleraldehyde oxidation: Effect of different operating parameters and chemical degradation pathway, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 91, 7, pp. 1307-1316, (2013); Assadi, Aymen Amine, Pilot scale degradation of mono and multi volatile organic compounds by surface discharge plasma/TiO2 reactor: Investigation of competition and synergism, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 357, pp. 305-313, (2018); Bellè, Umberto, A novel nanotubular TiO2-based Plug-Flow reactor for gas phase photocatalytic degradation of toluene, Chemical Engineering Journal, 437, (2022); Buyukada-Kesici, Esra, Design and fabrication of nano-engineered electrospun filter media with cellulose nanocrystal for toluene adsorption from indoor air, Materials Science and Engineering: B, 264, (2021); Frontistis, Zacharias, UV and simulated solar photodegradation of 17α-ethynylestradiol in secondary-treated wastewater by hydrogen peroxide or iron addition, Catalysis Today, 252, pp. 84-92, (2015)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","ESPLE","36538222","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144377878"

Plant-derived volatile organic compounds in particular influence the behavior and performance of other organisms. In this review, we discuss how vegetative plant volatiles derived from leaves, stems and roots are produced and released into the environment, how their production and release is modified by abiotic and biotic factors, and how they influence other organisms. Vegetative plant volatiles are derived from different biosynthesis and degradation pathways and are released via distinct routes. Both biosynthesis and release are regulated by other organisms as well as abiotic factors. In turn, vegetative plant volatiles modify the physiology and the behavior of a wide range of organisms, from microbes to mammals. Several concepts and frameworks can help to explain and predict the evolution and ecology of vegetative plant volatile emission patterns of specific pathways: multifunctionality of specialized metabolites, chemical communication displays and the information arms race, and volatile physiochemistry. We discuss how these frameworks can be leveraged to understand the evolution and expression patterns of vegetative plant volatiles. The multifaceted roles of vegetative plant volatiles provide fertile grounds to understand ecosystem dynamics and harness their power for sustainable agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Volatile Organic Compounds; Volatile Organic Compound; Agriculture; Animal; Chemistry; Ecology; Ecosystem; Mammal; Metabolism; Plant; Agriculture; Animals; Ecology; Ecosystem; Mammals; Plants; Volatile Organic Compounds","volatile organic compound; agriculture; animal; chemistry; ecology; ecosystem; mammal; metabolism; plant; Agriculture; Animals; Ecology; Ecosystem; Mammals; Plants; Volatile Organic Compounds","","Volatile Organic Compounds","This work is supported by the Swiss National Science foundation, grant numbers 200355 (to ME) and 210651 (to JMW), the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation of Switzerland, project CANWAS (to ME), the Velux Foundation, grant number 1231 (to ME and REB) and the University of Bern.","Takabayashi, Junji, Multifunctionality of herbivory-induced plant volatiles in chemical communication in tritrophic interactions, Current Opinion in Insect Science, 32, pp. 110-117, (2019); Loreto, Francesco R., Abiotic stresses and induced BVOCs, Trends in Plant Science, 15, 3, pp. 154-166, (2010); Zhou, Shaoqun, Molecular ecology of plant volatiles in interactions with insect herbivores, Journal of Experimental Botany, 73, 2, pp. 449-462, (2022); Raguso, Robert A., Wake up and smell the roses: The ecology and evolution of floral scent, Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 39, pp. 549-569, (2008); Kessler, Danny, Petunia flowers solve the defence/apparency dilemma of pollinator attraction by deploying complex floral blends, Ecology Letters, 16, 3, pp. 299-306, (2013); Caruso, Christina M., Do Plants Eavesdrop on Floral Scent Signals?, Trends in Plant Science, 21, 1, pp. 9-15, (2016); Turlings, T.

Catalytic combustion technology has been considered as one of the most prospective strategies for VOC elimination. This paper focuses on a review of studies on catalytic removal of typical VOCs (toluene) on transition metal oxide catalysts in recent years, with advances in single metal oxides, multi-oxide composites, and supported metal oxide catalysts. Firstly, the catalytic activities of a series of catalysts for toluene degradation are evaluated and compared, leading to an analysis of the key catalytic indicators that significantly affect the efficiency of toluene degradation. Secondly, the reaction pathway and mechanism of toluene degradation are systematically introduced. Considering the site space and investment cost, the conversion of VOC pollutants to harmless substances using existing selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems has been studied with considerable effort. Based on the current development of simultaneous multi-pollutant elimination technology, the interaction mechanism between the NH<inf>3</inf>-SCR reaction and toluene catalytic oxidation on the surface is discussed in detail. Finally, views on the key scientific issues and the challenges faced, as well as an outlook for the future, are presented.

Thus, it is particularly important to explore synergistic air cleaning technology to solve these problems. In this study, a pilot-scale air cleaning equipment were applied to an experimental manure storage house to determine the removal efficiency of gaseous pollution using four treatments groups. These treatment groups include acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing (AC), acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing + photocatalytic oxidation (ACP), acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing + biological scrubbing (ACB), and acid scrubbing + caustic scrubbing + biological scrubbing + photocatalytic oxidation (ACBP). Results showed that ACP can synergistically remove odor and bioaerosol, with ammonia, odor concentrations, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, methyl sulfide, bacterial aerosol, and fugal aerosol removal efficiencies of 89.1 %, 76.3 %, 100 %, 94.2 %, 91.2 %, 75.6 %, and 83.6 %, respectively. Furthermore, ACBP has the highest removal efficiency of 79.2 % for odor concentration, but this combination has a low inactivation efficiency (< 25 %) for bacterial aerosols.

In order for BF to be utilized in the industrial setting, it is essential to conduct research aimed at removing VOC mixtures under different inlet loading conditions, i.e. as a function of the gas flow rate and inlet VOC concentrations. The main aim of this study was to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) and determine the relationship between flow rate (FR), pressure drop (PD), inlet concentration (C), and removal efficiency (RE) in the BF treating gas-phase benzene and xylene mixtures. The ANN model was trained and tested to assess the removal efficiency of benzene (RE<inf>B</inf>) and xylene (RE<inf>X</inf>) under the influence of different FR, PD and C. The model's performance was assessed using a cross-validation method. The RE<inf>b</inf> varied from 20% to >60%, while the RE<inf>x</inf> varied from 10% to 70% during the different experimental phases of BF operation. The causal index (CI) technique was used to determine the sensitivity of the input parameters on the output variables. The ANN model with a topology of 4-4-2 performed the best in terms of predicting the RE profiles of both the pollutants. Furthermore, the effect was more pronounced for xylene because an increase in the benzene concentration reduced xylene removal (CI = −25.7170) more severely than benzene removal. An increase in the xylene concentration had a marginally positive effect on the benzene removal (CI = +0.1178). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofiltration; Mixture Of Vocs; Neural Networks; Transient State Operation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Benzene; Xylene; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes; Benzene; Xylene; Volatile Organic Compound; Artificial Neural Network; Biofiltration; Compost; Gas Flow; Performance Assessment; Pressure Drop; Acclimatization; Activated Sludge; Article; Carbon Source; Cross Validation; Empty Bed Residence Time; Flow Rate; Gas Chromatography; Microbial Consortium; Microorganism; Nonhuman; Soil Analysis; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Air Pollutant; Bioremediation; Composting; Filtration; Gas; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Biodegradation, Environmental; Composting; Filtration; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes","benzene; xylene; volatile organic compound; artificial neural network; biofiltration; compost; gas flow; performance assessment; pressure drop; acclimatization; activated sludge; Article; carbon source; cross validation; empty bed residence time; flow rate; gas chromatography; microbial consortium; microorganism; nonhuman; soil analysis; waste water treatment plant; air pollutant; bioremediation; composting; filtration; gas; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Biodegradation, Environmental; Composting; Filtration; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes","","benzene, 71-43-2; xylene, 1330-20-7; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes","This neural network based modeling work was supported by the Hanoi University of Civil Engineering [grant number 15-2019/KHXD-TĐ], Vietnam.","Abedi, Sobhan, Evaluation of the critical parameters on the removal efficiency of a botanical biofilter system, Building and Environment, 212, (2022); Biodegradation of Volatile Organic Vapours in Biofilter, (1999); Arvin, Erik, Substrate interactions during aerobic biodegradation of benzene, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 55, 12, pp. 3221-3225, (1989); 87th Annual Meeting and Exhibition of the Air and Waste Management Association, (1994); Bartels, Iris, Suicide inactivation of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida mt-2 by 3-halocatechols, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 47, 3, pp. 500-505, (1984); Divya, Baskaran, Experimental studies and neural network modeling of the removal of trichloroethylene vapor in a biofilter, Journal of Environmental Management, 250, (2019); Boojari, Mohammad Amin, Transient-state strategies for the removal of toluene vapor in a two-liquid phase biotrickling filter: Experimental study and neural network analysis, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 121, pp. 184-193, (2019); Campbell, Heather J., Practical experience with an industrial biofilter treating solvent vapour loads of varying magnitude and composition, Pure and Applied Chemistry, 69, 11, pp. 2411-2424, (1997); Cantera, Sara, Comparative evaluation of bacterial and fungal removal of indoor and industrial polluted air using suspended and packed bed bioreactors., Chemosphere, 308, (2022); Chairez-Oria, Isaac, Dynamic numerical reconstruction of a fungal biofiltration system using differential neural network, Journal of Process Control, 19, 7, pp. 1103-1110, (2009)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10960953; 00139351","","ENVRA","36403652","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143072046"

Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Co species (Co@NCNT) are synthesized by thermolysis of a ZIF-67/melamine mixture. The carbon-confinement effects in Co@NCNT not only improve the stability of Co species but also regulate the electronic structure of Co-C bonds, consequently synergistically improving the catalytic ozonation performance. The experimental results indicate that the Co@NCNT catalyst could still remove ∼86% of odorous methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) after running for 60 h at 25 °C under an initial concentration of 50 ppm CH3SH and 40 ppm ozone, relative humidity of 60%, and space velocity of 600,000 mL h-1 g-1, outdistancing reported values under comparable reaction conditions. Detailed characterization and theoretical simulations reveal that the electronic metal-support interaction of Co-C bonds in Co@NCNT significantly adjusts the electronic structure of Co species, thereby promoting ozone-specific adsorption/activation to convert the surface atomic oxygen (*Oad) and ·OH/1O2/·O2-. Also, the electrons obtained from CH3SH in the electron-poor center transferred through the C-Co bond bridge to maintain the redox cycle of Co0/2+ → Co3+ → Co0/2+ and realize the efficient and stable removal of CH3SH into CO2/SO42-/H2O. This work demonstrates that MOF-derived materials with tunable electronic structures achieve the stable removal efficiency for gaseous sulfur-containing VOCs via electron transfer trade-offs and provide potential candidate catalysts for the application of air purification. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Density Functional Theory; Electronic Metal-support Interaction; Metal-organic Frameworks; Sulfur-containing Vocs; Air Cleaners; Carbon Nanotubes; Catalysts; Cobalt; Commerce; Doping (additives); Economic And Social Effects; Electron Transitions; Electronic Structure; Nitrogen; Organometallics; Ozone; Ozonization; Redox Reactions; Sulfur Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Ozonation; Density-functional-theory; Electron Transfer; Electronic Metal-support Interaction; Electronic.structure; Metal-support Interactions; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Sulphur-containing Volatile Organic Compound; Trade Off; ]+ Catalyst; Density Functional Theory","Air cleaners; Carbon nanotubes; Catalysts; Cobalt; Commerce; Doping (additives); Economic and social effects; Electron transitions; Electronic structure; Nitrogen; Organometallics; Ozone; Ozonization; Redox reactions; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic ozonation; Density-functional-theory; Electron transfer; Electronic metal-support interaction; Electronic.structure; Metal-support interactions; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Sulphur-containing volatile organic compound; Trade off; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory","","","The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52070195, 21876212, 21673086, and 42207056), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (22lgqb21), and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Nos. 2019A1515011015 and 2021A1515110224) for financially supporting this work.","Estrada, José M., A comparative analysis of odour treatment technologies in wastewater treatment plants, Environmental Science and Technology, 45, 3, pp. 1100-1106, (2011); Qu, Wei, Self-Accelerating Interfacial Catalytic Elimination of Gaseous Sulfur-Containing Volatile Organic Compounds as Microbubbles in a Facet-Engineered Three-Dimensional BiOCl Sponge Fenton-Like Process, Environmental Science and Technology, 56, 16, pp. 11657-11669, (2022); Lee, Song-woo, Adsorption characteristics of methyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide, and trimethylamine on coconut-based activated carbons modified with acid and base, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 16, 6, pp. 973-977, (2010); van Leerdam, Robin C., Reactions between methanethiol and biologically produced sulfur particles, Environmental Science and Technology, 45, 4, pp. 1320-1326, (2011); Li, Xiangzhong, Photocatalytic oxidation of methyl mercaptan in foul gas for odor control, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 45, 2, pp. 487-494, (2006); Huang, Yajing, Enhanced Catalytic Ozonation for Eliminating CH3SH via Graphene-Supported Positively Charged Atomic Pt Undergoing Pt2+/Pt4+ Redox Cycle, Environmental Science and Technology, 55, 24, pp. 16723-16734, (2021); Hernández Mejía, Carlos, Activity enhancement of cobalt catalysts by tuning metal-support interactions, Nature Communications, 9, 1, (2018); Wu, Peiwen, Harnessing strong metal–support interactions via a reverse route, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Wang, Kuncan, A One-Stone-Two-Birds Strategy to Functionalized Carbon Nanocages, ACS Nano, 16, 9, pp. 15008-15015, (2022); Zhu, Changqing, Confinement of CoP Nanoparticles in Nitrogen-Doped Yolk-Shell Porous Carbon Polyhedron for Ultrafast Catalytic Oxidation, Advanced Functional Materials, 30, 49, (2020)","","American Chemical Society","","","","","","21555435","","ACCAC","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145212975"

These skin side effects have been reported to be linked to the break-down of homeostasis of the repair system against deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and tissue destruction. These can lead to accelerated aging, melanogenesis, and cell growth senescence or even cause cancer of the skin. Efforts to overcome these problems associated with synthetic cosmetics have led to the use of natural cosmetics of plant and animal origin. Natural cosmetics have been found to contain essential oils and other extracts that can alleviate or inhibit skinassociated problems, such as eczema, allergy, acne, dryness, and discoloration, while also containing anti-aging, anti-tyrosinase, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory substances. In this chapter, some cosmetics products from plants (herbs) and animal extraction are highlighted alongside their applications in skin care.

Such VOCs is used for painting and ink manufacturing facilities, solvents, adhesives, and manufacturing synthetic resins. The emitted VOCs are not only harmful to the human body, animals, and plants, but are also representative environmental pollutants that are released into the atmosphere and become secondary fine dust pollutants. VOCs cause photochemical reactions with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to generate ozone on the surface, contributing to warming and worsening respiratory diseases. Therefore, a number of techniques are being used to eliminate these VOCs and regenerative temperature oxidation(RTO) that oxidizes VOCs at high temperature and reuses waste heat to increase economic feasibility, and regenerative catalytic oxidation(RCO) technology that concentrates low concentration VOCs and catalytic oxidation at a relatively low temperature is mainly used. Although RCO technology has advantages due to low reaction temperature and low generation of secondary pollutants such as NOx compared to RTO, VOCs explosion limit, catalyst poisoning, regeneration, and long-term stability must be considered. This research evaluated the catalyst combustion characteristics of VOCs according to the type of VOC using the catalyst developed to effectively treat VOCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research was supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy(MOTIE), Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology(KEIT), [20015460]","Berenjian, A., Volatile Organic Compounds removal methods: A review, American Journal of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 8, 4, pp. 220-229, (2012); Hermia, Jacques, Catalytic incineration for odour abatement and VOC destruction, Catalysis Today, 17, 1-2, pp. 349-358, (1993); Tichenor, Bruce A., Destruction of volatile organic compounds via catalytic incineration, Environmental Progress, 6, 3, pp. 172-176, (1987)","Ensinger, W.; Jampilek, J.","Avestia Publishing","","8th World Congress on Recent Advances in Nanotechnology, RAN 2023","","Lisbon","297659","23715308","9781990800160; 9781927877197; 9781927877289; 9781990800504; 9781990800016; 9781927877883; 9781990800337; 9781927877739","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168626352"

This study aims to identify volatile organic compounds (VOC) released from the burning of porcine bones in the presence of diesel in a simulated controlled outdoor setting in Malaysia. Neat diesel was diluted with hexane with a ratio of 1:1 and administered into a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Porcine bone was burned to identify VOCs of porcine bones, whereas 30 mL diesel was burned together with porcine bones to identify VOCs produced from the combined burning. After the burning process, an activated carbon tablet was fixed to the burned sample. Later, the tablet was desorbed with hexane and analysed using GC-MS. Results revealed that the combined burning released a set of VOCs that were not detected in burned porcine bone or neat diesel. This work was able to enforce the detection of specific volatiles from various functional groups such as alkanes, isoalkanes, alkylbenzenes and ketones in the combined burning of diesel with porcine bones. It was also discovered that in the specific conditions applied and controlled in this study, most VOCs of porcine bone and diesel respectively were not detected in the combined burning of porcine bone and diesel. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activated Carbon Tablet; Comprimé De Charbon Actif; Diesel; Diesel; Gc-ms; Gc-ms; Os De Porc; Porcine Bone; Activated Carbon; Diesel Fuel; Hexane; Activated Carbon; Alkane; Diesel Fuel; Functional Group; Hexane; Ketone; Volatile Organic Compound; Animal Tissue; Article; Bone; Fire; Malaysia; Mass Fragmentography; Nonhuman; Pig; Simulation","activated carbon; alkane; diesel fuel; functional group; hexane; ketone; volatile organic compound; animal tissue; Article; bone; fire; Malaysia; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; pig; simulation","","activated carbon, 64365-11-3, 82228-96-4; diesel fuel, 68334-30-5; hexane, 110-54-3","This study was fully funded by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, project code GGPM-2017-014.","Bohnert, Michael, The degree of destruction of human bodies in relation to the duration of the fire, Forensic Science International, 95, 1, pp. 11-21, (1998); Use of Archaeological and Anthropological Methods in Fatal Fire Scene Investigations, (2009); Ellingham, Sarah Theresa Dorothea, Estimating temperature exposure of burnt bone - A methodological review, Science and Justice, 55, 3, pp. 181-188, (2015); Whyte, Thomas R., Distinguishing remains of human cremations from burned animal bones, Journal of Field Archaeology, 28, 3-4, pp. 437-448, (2003); An Investigation of the Volatiles Produced from Pyrolysis of the Body, (1999); DeHaan, John D., Combustion of animal fat and its implications for the consumption of human bodies in fires, Science and Justice, 39, 1, pp. 27-38, (1999); DeHaan, John D., Volatile organic compounds from the combustion of human and animal tissue, Science and Justice, 44, 4, pp. 223-236, (2004); Investigation of the Thermal Degradation Products of Bone, (2011); Analysis and Discrimination of Pyrolysis Products from Biological and Non Biological Sources, (2015); Gabriel, Gina Francesca, The analysis of thermal decomposition products generated from porcine tissues exposed to outdoor burning conditions, Malaysian Journal of Analytical Sciences, 21, 3, pp. 585-596, (2017)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","00085030","","JCFSB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152418254"

A case study was developed to better understand decisions, resources, expertise, and response limitations during and after the wildfire. The fire caused all water systems to lose power. Power loss was sometimes coupled with structure destruction, distribution depressurization, and the failure of backup power systems. These consequences jeopardized fire-fighting support and allowed for volatile organic compound and semi-volatile organic compound contamination of water distribution systems. Water system staff, with help from neighboring systems and external technical experts, stabilized the infrastructure, found and removed the contamination, and restored services.

Considerable attention has been paid to industrial activities due to their large and relatively complex VOCs emissions. The present research aims to provide a comprehensive review on whole-process control of industrial VOCs, which mainly includes source reduction, collection enhancement and end-pipe treatments. Lower VOCs materials including water-borne ones are the keys to source substitution in industries related to coating and solvent usage, leak detection and repair (LDAR) should be regarded as an efficient means of source reduction in refining, petrochemical and other chemical industries. Several types of VOCs collection methods such as gas-collecting hoods, airtight partitions and others are discussed, and airtight collection at negative pressure yields the best collection efficiency. Current end-pipe treatments like UV oxidation, low-temperature plasma, activated carbon adsorption, combustion, biodegradation, and adsorption-combustion are discussed in detail. Finally, several recommendations are made for future advanced treatment and policy development in industrial VOCs emission control. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collection Enhancement; End-pipe Treatments; Materials Substitution; Volatile Organic Compounds; Ozone; Air Pollutants; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds; Activated Carbon; Biodegradation; Chemical Detection; Chemical Industry; Combustion; Emission Control; Industrial Research; Process Control; Temperature; 'current; Adsorption Combustion; Collection Enhancement; End-pipe Treatment; Ground-level Ozone; Materials Substitutions; Organic Aerosol; Source Reduction; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; Whole Process; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption; Biodegradation; Combustion; Emission Control; Industrial Emission; Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compound; China; Ozone; Air Pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds","Activated carbon; Biodegradation; Chemical detection; Chemical industry; Combustion; Emission control; Industrial research; Process control; Temperature; 'current; Adsorption combustion; Collection enhancement; End-pipe treatment; Ground-level ozone; Materials substitutions; Organic aerosol; Source reduction; Volatile organic compound emission; Whole process; Volatile organic compounds; adsorption; biodegradation; combustion; emission control; industrial emission; oxidation; volatile organic compound; China; ozone; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds","","ozone, 10028-15-6; Air Pollutants; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds","This work was supported by the R&D Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (No. KJZD20191443001 ), the Project of Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission (No. Z181100000118003 ), and the Foundation of Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection (No. Y2020-011 ).","Abdullah, A.

Abatement of VCs from different processing periods of SS composting was determined. 100% removal of major species of VCs (methyl isobutyl ketone, carbon disulfide, chlorobenzene and methylene chloride, etc.) were determined during the ‘before turning (B.T)’ and ‘5 h after turning (A.T)’ process. In addition, the synergistic effect of plasma-catalyst (Pt–Sn/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, BaTiO<inf>3</inf> and HZSM-5) on VCs abatement showed enhanced removal performance as the formation of reactive species (H and OH radicals) was increased, especially on the surface of the catalyst.

In this review, various types of catalysts are categorized and evaluated by exploring their enhancement effect in plasma-catalytic system to indicate their synergistic excellence and application limitation. Besides, the detailed research of synergistic mechanism between plasma and catalysis is given more attention, which is rapidly progressing due to the development of in-situ experimental techniques and kinetic analysis approach.

The homogeneous Fe2+ catalyzed Fenton reaction remains an attractive advanced oxidation process (AOPs) for the degradation of hazardous organic contaminants, but limited by due to the poor permeability of wood and wide distribution of extractives, the effective removal of wood extractives remained a challenge. Herein, a facile approach toward forming an in-situ ·OH radical generation platform was proposed by introducing EDTA-Fe2+ chelating agent into parenchyma cells and resin canals of wood by vacuum impregnation. Oxidation process was carried out using a ""respiratory impregnation""method that imitated human respiration. The Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis reveals that·OH was generated in-situ as the primary reactive species. Various controlling factors, including Fe2+ concentration, pH value, and H2O2 concentration were evaluated. The removal rate of VOCs was estimated by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). The best results (89.5% removal without cycling treatment) were observed at pH = 3, H2O2 = 20 mM and Fe2+ = 200 mM.

There were electronic and structural changes in the thermally aged Pt-Pd/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, as confirmed by numerous analyses. Both Pt and Pd existed in a metallic rather than oxidized state without additional reduction steps. The noble metal particles were assembled to form Pt-Pd alloy, in the form of isolated Pd atoms surrounded by Pt atoms.

The emissions of VOCs from the iron ore sintering process have been ignored until now, despite the well-documented atmospheric and human health hazards associated with VOCs. The mechanisms of VOC emissions during sintering process are discussed. The incomplete combustion of ignition gases and coal/coke particles in the sintering mix is the main cause of VOC emissions. In fact, the low concentration of VOCs in sintering flue gas masks the truth about the immense amount of VOC emissions. This review highlights the real and non-negligible risk of atmospheric pollution by VOCs from sintering sources, as well as the urgency to awaken researchers and policy makers. The authors explore feasible pathways to control VOCs based on current commercially applied sintering flue gas treatment technologies. Meanwhile, this article briefly outlines a range of major technologies, methods, processes, and materials available for the VOC emissions control of industrial flue gases, and focuses on catalytic combustion for VOC treatment, in particular the development of perovskite-type catalysts, such as selection, design, modification, loading, etc. Great promise has been demonstrated in applying perovskite catalysts in removal of VOCs from flue gas over the years, but developing highly active perovskite-type catalysts with anti-toxicity and long-time stability requires additional efforts. The sintering flue gas VOCs face a variety of challenges in terms of policy regulation, financial investment, basic materials research, and commercial solutions. Remarkably, it is vitally important to explore the possibility of synergistic oxidation of VOCs, NO<inf>x</inf>, and PCDD/Fs by exploiting the high oxidation properties of perovskite materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysts; Catalytic Combustion; Iron Ore Sintering; Perovskite Oxides; Sintering Flue Gas; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Catalysis; Catalysts; Coal Combustion; Economic Geology; Flue Gases; Flues; Fossil Fuels; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Health Hazards; Industrial Emissions; Iron Ores; Ore Sintering; Catalytic Combustion; Emission Of Volatile Organic Compounds; Emissions Control; Iron Ore Sintering; Perovskite Oxides; Sintering Flue Gas; Sintering Process; Volatile Organic Compound; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; ]+ Catalyst; Volatile Organic Compounds","Catalysis; Catalysts; Coal combustion; Economic geology; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health hazards; Industrial emissions; Iron ores; Ore sintering; Catalytic combustion; Emission of volatile organic compounds; Emissions control; Iron ore sintering; Perovskite oxides; Sintering flue gas; Sintering process; Volatile organic compound; Volatile organic compound emission; ]+ catalyst; Volatile organic compounds","","","The authors are grateful acknowledges support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant No. 52174290], the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant No. 52004001], the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [Grant No. 21KJB450002], as well the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant No. RGPIN-2019-05159].

A multi-purpose photocatalyst filter with photocatalytic nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (PNT) incorporated into non-woven polymer fibers (NWPF) with wide applications is focused on in detail in this work. Loading of PNT on NWPF is carried out by the simple dip coating method. Para-xylene is selected as the target pollutant for the removal of organic contaminants. Higher removal efficiency of p-xylene (94.2%) is achieved under fluorescent daylight. The filtration efficiency of PNT is also evaluated to capture PM<inf>2.5–10</inf>, which is increased with higher loading content of PNT. At a high air flow rate, the filtration efficiency of the photocatalyst PNT/NWPF is 97.33%, whereas the efficiency of the pristine NWPF is 91.1%. Moreover, the PNT/NWPF filter exhibits excellent antibacterial activity (99.9%) under visible light irradiation, but the pristine NWPF filter has negligible destruction effects on pathogens. These results clearly indicate that a PNT-coated NWPF filter would be an outstanding multi-purpose material for indoor air purification systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disinfection; Dust Capture; E.

Titanium dioxide (TiO<inf>2</inf>), which is an excellent photocatalyst, has received extensive attention because it is inexpensive and able to photocatalytically degrade pollutants in an environmentally friendly manner. TiO<inf>2</inf> has many advantages, including high chemical stability, low toxicity, low operating costs, and environmental friendliness. TiO<inf>2</inf> is an N-order semiconductor material with a bandgap of 3.2 eV. Only when the wavelength of ultraviolet light is less than or equal to 387.5 nm, the valence band electrons can obtain the energy of the photon and pass through the conduction band to form photoelectrons, meanwhile the valence band forms a photogenerated hole. And light in other wavelength regions does not excite this photogenerated electrons. The most common methods used to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO<inf>2</inf> involve increasing its photoresponse range and reducing photogenerated-carrier coupling. The morphology, size, and structure of a heterojunction can be altered through element doping, leading to improved photocatalytic efficiency. Mainstream methods for preparing TiO<inf>2</inf> are reviewed in this paper, with several excellent preparation schemes for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO<inf>2</inf> introduced. TiO<inf>2</inf> is mainly prepared using sol-gel, solvothermal, hydrothermal, anodic oxidation, microwave-assisted, CVD and PVD methods, and TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles with excellent photocatalytic properties can also be prepared. Ti-containing materials are widely used to purify harmful gases, as well as contaminants from building materials, coatings, and daily necessities. Therefore, the preparation and applications of titanium materials have become globally popular research topics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Composite Catalyst; Photodegradation; Titania Preparation; Titanium Dioxide","","","","","Chow, Judith C., Introduction to the A&WMA 2006 Critical Review: Health effects of fine particulate air pollution: Lines that connect, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 56, 6, pp. 707-708, (2006); Zhang, Junfeng Jim, Household air pollution from coal and biomass fuels in China: Measurements, health impacts, and interventions, Environmental Health Perspectives, 115, 6, pp. 848-855, (2007); Jones, Andy Peter, Indoor air quality and health, Atmospheric Environment, 33, 28, pp. 4535-4564, (1999); Mumford, Judy Lee, Lung cancer and indoor air pollution in Xuan Wei, China, Science, 235, 4785, pp. 217-220, (1987); Pope, C.

An oxidation product of limonene, carvone, has been reported to cause contact allergens. In this study, we have investigated the interactions of limonene and carvone with TiO<inf>2</inf>, a component of paint and self-cleaning surfaces, at 297 ± 1 K with FTIR spectroscopy and force field-based molecular dynamics and ab initio simulations. The IR absorption spectra and computational methods show that limonene forms π-hydrogen bonds with the surface O-H groups on the TiO<inf>2</inf> surface and that carvone adsorbs on the TiO<inf>2</inf> surface through a variety of molecular interactions including through carbonyl oxygen atoms with Ti4+ surface atoms, O-H hydrogen bonding (carbonyl O⋯HO) and π-hydrogen bonds with surface O-H groups. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of relative humidity (RH) on the adsorption of limonene and carvone on the TiO<inf>2</inf> surface. The spectroscopic results show that the adsorbed limonene can be completely displaced by water at a relative humidity of ca. 50% RH (∼2 MLs of water) and that 25% of carvone is displaced at ca. 67% RH, which agrees with the calculated free energies of adsorption which show carvone more strongly adsorbs on the surface relative to limonene and thus would be harder to displace from the surface. Overall, this study shows how a monoterpene and its oxidation product interact with TiO<inf>2</inf> and the impact of relative humidity on these interactions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carvone; Limonene; Oxygen; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Water; Carvone; Cyclohexane Monoterpenes; Limonene; Monoterpenes; Oxygen; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Water; Air Cleaners; Computational Chemistry; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Hydrogen Bonds; Molecular Dynamics; Molecular Oxygen; Titanium Dioxide; Ab Initio Simulations; Air Fresheners; Carvone; Cleaning Products; Forcefields; Ftir Spectroscopy; Indoor Environment; Oxidation Products; Self-cleaning Surfaces; Titanium Dioxide Surfaces; Monoterpenes; Carvone; Limonene; Oxygen; Terpene; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Water; Chemistry; Cyclohexane Monoterpenes; Limonene; Oxygen; Titanium; Water","Air cleaners; Computational chemistry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogen bonds; Molecular dynamics; Molecular oxygen; Titanium dioxide; Ab initio simulations; Air fresheners; Carvone; Cleaning products; Forcefields; FTIR spectroscopy; Indoor environment; Oxidation products; Self-cleaning surfaces; Titanium dioxide surfaces; Monoterpenes; carvone; limonene; oxygen; terpene; titanium; titanium dioxide; water; chemistry; Cyclohexane Monoterpenes; Limonene; Oxygen; Titanium; Water","","carvone, 99-49-0; limonene, 138-86-3, 5989-27-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; titanium, 7440-32-6; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; water, 7732-18-5; carvone; Cyclohexane Monoterpenes; Limonene; Monoterpenes; Oxygen; Titanium; titanium dioxide; Water","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Alfred P.

Herein, we established a microbubble-assisted Fenton-like process to eliminate malodorous microbubble CH<inf>3</inf>SH as representative gaseous S-VOCs, in which BiOCl nanosheets loaded on a three-dimensional sponge were exposed to (001) or (010) facets and induced Fenton-like interface reactions. Intriguingly, the microbubble-assisted Fenton-like process significantly removed 99.9% of CH<inf>3</inf>SH, higher than that of the macrobubble-assisted Fenton-like process (39.0%). The self-accelerating interfacial catalytic mechanism was in-depth identified by in situ ATR-FTIR, PTR-TOF-MS, EPR, and DFT computational study. The extraordinary elimination performance of microbubble-assisted Fenton-like process lies in the enhancing dissolution/mass transfer of gaseous CH<inf>3</inf>SH in the gas/liquid phase and the tight contact between CH<inf>3</inf>SH-microbubbles and 3D-BiOCl sponge due to the low rising velocity (0.13 mm s-1) and negative charge (-45.53 mV) of CH<inf>3</inf>SH-microbubbles, as well as the effective generation of 1O<inf>2</inf>by activating the enriched dissolved oxygen in CH<inf>3</inf>SH-microbubble via effective electron-polarized sites on 3D-BiOCl sponge. Furthermore, CH<inf>3</inf>SH-microbubbles transferred electrons to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>through electron-rich oxygen vacancy centers of the 3D-BiOCl sponge to generate more •OH, thus achieving excellent elimination performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the enhanced self-accelerating interfacial catalytic elimination by S-VOC microbubble and provides the underlying mechanisms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Facet-engineered Biocl Sponge; Fenton-like Process; Microbubbles; Oxygen Vacancy; Self-accelerating Interfacial Catalysis; Sulfur; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxygen; Gases; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxygen; Sulfur; Volatile Organic Compounds; Bismuth Compounds; Catalysis; Dissolved Oxygen; Oxidation; Oxygen Vacancies; Quantum Chemistry; Sulfur Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Elimination; Exposed To; Facet-engineered Biocl Sponge; Fenton Likes; Fenton-like Process; Innovative Strategies; Interface Reactions; Microbubbles; Performance; Self-accelerating Interfacial Catalyse; Chlorine Compounds; Dissolved Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Sulfur; Thiol; Volatile Organic Compound; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxygen; Velocity Profile; Article; Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Catalysis; Contact Angle; Cyclic Voltammetry; Electron Transport; Energy Consumption; Fenton Reaction; Flow Rate; Heat Treatment; Hydrophilicity; Microbubble; Mineralization; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Petrochemical Industry; Photocatalysis; Reaction Time; Static Electricity; Synthesis; Zeta Potential; Gas; Fenton; Michigan; United States; Gases; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxygen; Sulfur; Volatile Organic Compounds","Bismuth compounds; Catalysis; Dissolved oxygen; Oxidation; Oxygen vacancies; Quantum chemistry; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic elimination; Exposed to; Facet-engineered BiOCl sponge; Fenton likes; Fenton-like process; Innovative strategies; Interface reactions; Microbubbles; Performance; Self-accelerating interfacial catalyse; Chlorine compounds; dissolved oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; sulfur; thiol; volatile organic compound; hydrogen peroxide; oxygen; velocity profile; Article; attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; catalysis; contact angle; cyclic voltammetry; electron transport; energy consumption; Fenton reaction; flow rate; heat treatment; hydrophilicity; microbubble; mineralization; oxidation reduction reaction; petrochemical industry; photocatalysis; reaction time; static electricity; synthesis; zeta potential; gas; Fenton; Michigan; United States; Gases; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxygen; Sulfur; Volatile Organic Compounds","","sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Gases; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxygen; Sulfur; Volatile Organic Compounds","The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 52070195, 21876212, 21976214, 41603097, 21673086), Science and Technology Research Programs of Guangdong Province (no. 2019A1515011015), the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (201904010353), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (13lgjc10, 19lgpy157) for financially supporting this work.

Degradation of VOCs has aroused widespread concern. Catalytic oxidation is considered as an effective method to degrade VOCs. Microwave heating is a promising technology for heterogeneous catalytic gas–solid reactions, which is considered as an alternative to conventional conductive heating. Here, microwave enhanced catalytic degradation of VOCs were carried out in a novel double ridge field compressed cavity, in which Cu-Mn/AC catalyst was applied. The relative permittivity of Cu-Mn/AC at different temperatures were obtained by neural network. Further, based on the relative permittivity obtained, numerical simulations for the double ridge field compressed cavity were conducted at 2.45 GHz by a coupled three-dimensional electromagnetic-thermal model using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The simulation results of electric field distribution and temperature distribution in cavity present similar trend to the experimental results. Experimentally, the degradation of ethanol, benzene and acetone were carried out in this reactor for 50 W and 70 W at 2.45 GHz with the concentration and gas flow rate of 1000 ppm and 18 L/min. At 70 W and 2.45 GHz, the degradation efficiency of ethanol, benzene and acetone reached 99%, 70% and 99%, leading higher energy efficiency than other VOCs degradation methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Double Ridge Field Compressed Cavity; Energy Efficiency; Microwave Enhanced Catalytic; Numerical Simulation; Volatile Organic Compounds Degradation; Acetone; Benzene; Catalytic Oxidation; Computer Software; Degradation; Electric Fields; Energy Efficiency; Ethanol; Flow Of Gases; Gas Chromatography; Microwave Heating; Numerical Models; Organic Pollutants; Permittivity; Surface Roughness; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Degradation; Conductive Heating; Double Ridge Field Compressed Cavity; Gas-solid Reaction; Microwave Enhanced Catalytic; Microwave-heating; Relative Permittivity; Ridge Fields; Volatile Organic Compound Degradation; ]+ Catalyst; Microwaves","Acetone; Benzene; Catalytic oxidation; Computer software; Degradation; Electric fields; Energy efficiency; Ethanol; Flow of gases; Gas chromatography; Microwave heating; Numerical models; Organic pollutants; Permittivity; Surface roughness; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic degradation; Conductive heating; Double ridge field compressed cavity; Gas-solid reaction; Microwave enhanced catalytic; Microwave-heating; Relative permittivity; Ridge fields; Volatile organic compound degradation; ]+ catalyst; Microwaves","","","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No: 61731013 ) and State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering (Grant No: sklpme2021-4-04).","Air Pollution and Control, (2018); Mozaffar, Ahsan, Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in China: a Review, Current Pollution Reports, 6, 3, pp. 250-263, (2020); Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric chemistry of VOCs and NO(x), Atmospheric Environment, 34, 12-14, pp. 2063-2101, (2000); Prlj, Antonio, On the Theoretical Determination of Photolysis Properties for Atmospheric Volatile Organic Compounds, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 11, 14, pp. 5418-5425, (2020); Rong, Shaopeng, Engineering Crystal Facet of α-MnO2 Nanowire for Highly Efficient Catalytic Oxidation of Carcinogenic Airborne Formaldehyde, ACS Catalysis, 8, 4, pp. 3435-3446, (2018); Lee, Jung-eun, Recent advances in volatile organic compounds abatement by catalysis and catalytic hybrid processes: A critical review, Science of the Total Environment, 719, (2020); Zhao, Pu, Optimized porous clay heterostructure for removal of acetaldehyde and toluene from indoor air, Frontiers of Environmental Science and Engineering, 10, 2, pp. 219-228, (2016); Hou, Bo, Glycine based modification of activated carbons for VOCs adsorption, Chemical Engineering Journal Advances, 7, (2021); Berenjian, A., Volatile Organic Compounds removal methods: A review, American Journal of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 8, 4, pp. 220-229, (2012); Sarkar, Priyanka, Biofiltration as a green technology for abatement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): A synoptic review, pp. 477-496, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128354005"

From various advanced technologies for VOC mitigation, catalytic oxidation technology stands out as the modern and efficient method. This review presents the recent advances in the development and usage of novel catalysts for deep catalytic oxidation from the perspective of industrial feasibility. The goal is to efficiently contribute to cleaner production and provide cost-effective VOC emissions treatment by incorporating upscaled novel catalysts into VOC abatement technology. Different washcoats and active compound mixtures are developed and tested by many research groups worldwide. Extensive state-of-the-art of experimental data (129 data samples) on preferably noble metal-based catalysts and multi-metal oxides catalysts was carried out. The data are comprehensively summarized to identify generically optimal conditions to make efficient VOC abatement industrial gas catalyst with good conversions, long-term reliability, reasonable price and realistic possibilities for upscaling. Best reported T<inf>50</inf> and T<inf>90</inf> (temperatures corresponding to 50% and 90% conversions) for toluene were 110 °C and 144 °C, for ethanol 130 °C and 155 °C and for acetone 205 °C and 236 °C, respectively. The best performing catalysts surface areas were in the range of 16–103 m2 g−1. Furthermore, perspectives for the future development of novel VOC catalysts are provided. Particularly, the novel field of waste-to-catalysts and structured nanocatalyst development is explored. Lastly, the issues of upscaling to pilot and full-scale for each catalytic approach were discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollutants; Catalyst; Catalytic Oxidation; Gas Cleaning; Industrial Emission; Voc; Acetone; Air Cleaners; Air Pollution; Catalytic Oxidation; Cost Effectiveness; Industrial Emissions; Nanocatalysts; Precious Metals; Advanced Technology; Air Pollutants; Cost Effective; Emission Abatement; Gas Cleaning; Novel Catalysts; Oxidation Technology; Upscaling; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; ]+ Catalyst; Volatile Organic Compounds","Acetone; Air cleaners; Air pollution; Catalytic oxidation; Cost effectiveness; Industrial emissions; Nanocatalysts; Precious metals; Advanced technology; Air pollutants; Cost effective; Emission abatement; Gas cleaning; Novel catalysts; Oxidation technology; Upscaling; Volatile organic compound emission; ]+ catalyst; Volatile organic compounds","","","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE grant number CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413 ″Strategic Partnership for environmental Technologies and Energy Production"".","Abbasi, Zahra, Synthesis and physicochemical characterizations of nanostructured Pt/Al2O3-CeO2 catalysts for total oxidation of VOCs, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 186, 2-3, pp. 1445-1454, (2011); Aboukaïs, Antoine, A comparative study of Cu, Ag and Au doped CeO2 in the total oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Materials Chemistry and Physics, 177, pp. 570-576, (2016); Ahn, Chiwoong, Catalytic combustion of volatile organic compound over spherical-shaped copper–manganese oxide, Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 47, pp. 439-445, (2017); Amrute, Amol P., Performance, structure, and mechanism of CeO 2 in HCl oxidation to Cl 2, Journal of Catalysis, 286, pp. 287-297, (2012); Aranzábal, Asier, Kinetics of Pd/alumina catalysed 1,2-dichloroethane gas-phase oxidation, Chemical Engineering Science, 61, 11, pp. 3564-3576, (2006); Barakat, Tarek, Noble-metal-based catalysts supported on zeolites and macro-mesoporous metal oxide supports for the total oxidation of volatile organic compounds, ChemSusChem, 4, 10, pp. 1420-1430, (2011); Barakat, Tarek, Pd- and/or Au-loaded Nb- and V-doped macro-mesoporous TiO2 supports as catalysts for the total oxidation of VOCs, European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry, 16, pp. 2812-2818, (2012); Barakat, Tarek, Total oxidation of toluene over noble metal based Ce, Fe and Ni doped titanium oxides, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 146, pp. 138-146, (2014); Bedi, Umang, Modeling the combustion of volatile organic compound (VOC) ethane in monolithic catalytic converter, Materials Today: Proceedings, 28, pp. 1727-1731, (2020); Bedia, Jorge, Pd supported on mesoporous activated carbons with high oxidation resistance as catalysts for toluene oxidation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 94, 1-2, pp. 8-18, (2010)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130537620"

The addition of transition metal dopants to the Fe–Mn catalyst significantly improved the performance of plasma-catalyzed EO oxidation compared to the reaction using plasma only and the Fe–Mn catalyst. The highest EO conversion (91.9%) and CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity (78.9%) were obtained over the Fe–Mn–Co catalyst at a specific energy input (SEI) of 730.2 J l−1. Moreover, the presence of water vapor improved EO conversion and CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity in the relative humidity (RH) range of 0–60%, while further increasing the RH to 80% reduced EO conversion. The interactions between Fe, Mn and dopants increased the specific surface area and pore volume of the Fe–Mn-X catalyst, while maintaining the crystalline structure of the catalysts. The presence of the dopants enhanced the reducibility of the Fe–Mn-X catalysts and produced more surface adsorbed oxygen (O<inf>ads</inf>) on the catalyst surfaces. Moreover, the interactive effects among the Fe, Mn and dopants facilitated the plasma-catalytic oxidation reactions via enhanced surface reactions. The coupling of plasma with the Fe–Mn–Co catalyst reduced the formation of organic by-products in the plasma-catalyzed oxidation of EO. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Oxidation; Ethylene Oxide; Fe–mn Based Catalysts; Non-thermal Plasma; Plasma Catalysis; Volatile Organic Compound; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst Selectivity; Catalytic Oxidation; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Dielectric Materials; Ethylene; Manganese; Surface Reactions; Advanced Oxidation; Co Catalysts; Ethylene Oxides; Fe Mn Catalyst; Fe–mn Based Catalyst; Mn-based Catalysts; Nonthermal Plasma; Plasma Catalysis; Ternary Catalysts; ]+ Catalyst; Volatile Organic Compounds","Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst selectivity; Catalytic oxidation; Dielectric barrier discharge; Dielectric materials; Ethylene; Manganese; Surface reactions; Advanced oxidation; Co catalysts; Ethylene oxides; Fe Mn catalyst; Fe–mn based catalyst; Mn-based catalysts; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma catalysis; Ternary catalysts; ]+ catalyst; Volatile organic compounds","","","X.

To reach ultra-low emission standards, photocatalysis has emerged as a environmentally benign and efficient method to lower pollutant levels. Understanding the pollutant removal mechanism is necessary to optimize the design of the photocatalyst. Here, we review air purification by gas–solid photooxidation. We discuss the role of light absorption, charge carrier separation and active sites for designing the photocatalyst. We present reaction processes with emphasis on the adsorption and activation of reactants, the formation of intermediates and byproducts, and the conversion pathways towards the final product.

Interestingly, the T<inf>90</inf> value of the defect enhanced-CoMnNiO<inf>x</inf> catalyst for propane oxidation was only 200 °C. The de-aluminum and de-lithium process generated by the alkaline etching promoted the increase of the oxygen vacancy defects, which was confirmed by ICP-OES, XPS, EPR and DFT calculations. At the atomic level, the oxygen vacancies near the aluminum and lithium vacancies (NiO-Al<inf>v</inf>-O<inf>v</inf> and NiO-Li<inf>v</inf>-O<inf>v</inf>) were more likely to promote the activation of oxygen molecules. Furthermore, it was observed that the reducibility, acidity and lattice oxygen mobility of the defective CoMnNiO<inf>x</inf> catalyst were boosted by the presence of abundant oxygen vacancy defects, and thus enhancing the catalytic activity.

Dynamic adsorption experiments were conducted using a 500 ppm<inf>v</inf>-laden feed at 25 °C and 1 atm, followed by in situ catalytic oxidation at 200 °C. Among the DFMs investigated, 1Pt2Ni/ZrSi emerged as the material with overall in situ conversion of ∼96% due to its retaively high PtNi acid sites density compared with other DFMs. Kinetic analysis was conducted on 1Pt2Ni/ZrSi by investigating the effects of feed concentration, regenerative feed flow rate, and oxidation temperature on the benzene conversion in the sequential adsorption-oxidation process. The results of the kinetic analysis revealed that a complete oxidation can be attained over 1Pt2Ni/ZrSi and its performance can be improved upon decreasing adsorptive feed benzene concentration (maximum value of 99.7% at 125 ppm<inf>v</inf>) and regenerative feed flow rate (100% at 5 mL/min), and increasing oxidation temperature (100% at 200 °C).

A hybrid system integrating non-thermal-plasma and catalysis is regarded as one of the most promising technologies for VOCs removal due to their high VOCs removal efficiency, product selectivity and energy efficiency. This review systematically documents the main findings and improvements of VOCs removal using plasma-catalysis technology in recent 10 years. To better understand the fundamental relation between different aspects of this research field, this review mainly addresses the catalyst development, key influential factors, generation of by-products and reaction mechanism of VOCs decomposition in the plasma-catalysis process. Also, a comparison of the performance in various VOCs removal processes is provided.

Cu-Ce based catalyst is a promising catalyst, and the oxygen vacancies dominants the catalytic oxidation process but the traditional calcination is not conducive to its generation. Herein a series of CuO/CeO2 nanorod catalysts for toluene oxidation were prepared with non-equilibrium plasma comparing with traditional calcination. It is found that the treatment of non-equilibrium plasma after calcination can significantly enhance the synergism between CuO active phase and CeO2 support leading to high dispersion of CuO. And the non-equilibrium plasma is favorable to increase Cu+/Cu2+ and Ce3+/Ce4+ ratios generating more oxygen vacancies in the catalyst.

The depletion rate increases as a function of plasma power and concentration for propane, pentane and acetone. The efficiency evaluated as quantity of propane per unit of energy takes values between 2 and 7.5 g/kWh.

Evaluations at empty bed residence times (EBRTs) of 90, 60, and 30 s and inlet loading rates (LRs) ranging from 25.5 to 186.1 g m−3 h−1 were conducted. The maximum elimination capacity (EC) of 173.7 g m−3 h−1 was obtained at an inlet LR of 186.1 g m−3 h−1 at 90 s EBRT. Reducing the EBRT to 60 and 30 s resulted in decline of removal efficiency (RE). The performance of BTF was modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict styrene RE using measurable inputs, inlet LR, EBRT, and pressure drop. The model performance was assessed by mean square error and overall coefficient of correlation. The influence of different input parameters on the output was analyzed using casual index. Styrene removal was positively influenced by the increase in EBRTs, negatively impacted by its inlet LRs, while pressure drop had a negligible effect. The BTF was then exposed to intermittent loading phases by varying operational conditions during the non-loading periods. The results from this study confirmed that rhamnolipids could enhance the BTF performance for handling transient load variations at unsteady-state conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biotrickling Filter; Intermittent Loading; Modeling; Neural Networks; Rhamnolipids; Styrene; Biofilters; Drops; Frequency Response; Lipids; Loading; Mean Square Error; Pressure Drop; Styrene; Surface Active Agents; Bio-trickling Filters; Empty Bed Residence Time; Intermittent Loading; Loading Rate; Modeling; Neural-networks; Performances Evaluation; Removal Efficiencies; Rhamnolipids; Styrene Removal; Neural Networks","Biofilters; Drops; Frequency response; Lipids; Loading; Mean square error; Pressure drop; Styrene; Surface active agents; Bio-trickling filters; Empty bed residence time; Intermittent loading; Loading rate; Modeling; Neural-networks; Performances evaluation; Removal efficiencies; Rhamnolipids; Styrene removal; Neural networks","","","We would like to thank Dr. David Wendell for providing supplies and allowing us to use his lab for several microbiological experiments.

The skin of the automobile instrument panel is an appearance part, which requires excellent friction loss resistance of surface. In this paper, the high-flow SEBS/PP blended thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) suitable for the preparation of injection molding skins for automobile instrument panel was studied. By comparing the Taber abrasion and cross-scratch properties, the effects of SEBS’s molecular weight, styrene content in the molecule, molecular structure and types of lubricating agents on the friction loss properties of the material were investigated. The results show that under the same SEBS molecular structure, the higher the molecular weight within a certain range, the better the wear resistance of high-flow SEBS/PP type TPE, but the ultra-high molecular weight exhibits lower wear resistance than high molecular weight; The high-flow SEBS/PP blended TPE prepared by medium styrene content SEBS has better abrasion resistance; TPE prepared by star SEBS is better than linear SEBS; Adding silane-based lubricating agents is beneficial to improve the friction loss resistance of the material, especially combined use of high and low molecular weight silicone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abrasion Resistance; Automotive Interior; High-flow Thermoplastic Elastomer; Hydrogenated Styrene-butadiene-styrene Block Copolymer; Injection Molding Soft Skin; Abrasion; Block Copolymers; Butadiene; Erosion; Esters; Hydrogenation; Injection Molding; Molecular Structure; Olefins; Reinforced Plastics; Rubber; Silicones; Styrene; Thermoplastic Elastomers; Tribology; Automotive Interiors; Butadiene-styrene Block Copolymer; Friction Loss; High Flow; High-flow Thermoplastic Elastomer; Hydrogenated Styrene-butadiene-styrene Block Copolymer; Injection Molding Soft Skin; Property; Styrene/butadiene/styrene; Thermoplastics (elastomers); Wear Resistance","Abrasion; Block copolymers; Butadiene; Erosion; Esters; Hydrogenation; Injection molding; Molecular structure; Olefins; Reinforced plastics; Rubber; Silicones; Styrene; Thermoplastic elastomers; Tribology; Automotive interiors; Butadiene-styrene block copolymer; Friction loss; High flow; High-flow thermoplastic elastomer; Hydrogenated styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer; Injection molding soft skin; Property; Styrene/butadiene/styrene; Thermoplastics (elastomers); Wear resistance","","","","Yang, Chengjung, An innovative design of regional air conditioning to increase automobile cabin energy efficiency, Energies, 12, 12, (2019); Soutis, C., Carbon fiber reinforced plastics in aircraft construction, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 412, 1-2, pp. 171-176, (2005); Kristanto, Daniel, Sensitivity Analysis of Energy Conversion for Effective Energy Consumption, Thermal Comfort, and Air Quality within Car Cabin, Energy Procedia, 138, pp. 552-557, (2017); Franco-Urquiza, Edgar Adrian, Innovation in aircraft cabin interior panels.

The construction of an electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) coordination structure to maximize the number of active sites and increase the intrinsic activity of active sites is an effective means to improve catalytic performance. In this work, the abundant Si-OH groups on PSBA-15 (SBA-15 before calcination) were used to anchor Mn to form a Si-O-Mn-based EMSI coordination structure. Detailed characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect significantly adjusts and stabilizes the electronic structure of Mn 3d states, resulting in an electron-rich center on the Si-O-Mn bond to promote the specific adsorption/activation of ozone (O3) and an electron-poor center on the (Si-O-)Mn-O bond to adsorb a large amount of CH3SH accompanied by its own oxidative degradation. In situ Raman and in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses identify that catalytic ozonation over 3.0Mn-PSBA generates atomic oxygen species (AOS/*O) and reactive oxygen species (ROS/•O2-) to achieve efficient decomposition of CH3SH into CO2/SO42-. Furthermore, the electrons obtained from CH3SH in electron-poor centers are transferred to maintain the redox cycle of Mn2+/3+ → Mn4+ → Mn2+/3+ through the internal bond bridge, thus accomplishing the efficient and stable degradation of CH3SH prolonged to 180 min. Therefore, the rational design of catalysts with abundant active sites and optimized inherent activity via the EMSI effect can provide significant potential to improve catalytic performance and eliminate odorous gases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Ch3sh; Electronic Metal-support Interaction; Mn/sba-15; Si-o-mn; Manganese; Ozone; Silicon; Sulfur; Thiol Derivative; Catalyst Activity; Electronic Structure; Electrons; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Manganese; Ozone; Ozonization; Redox Reactions; Silicon Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Active Site; Catalytic Ozonation; Catalytic Performance; Coordination Structures; Electronic Metal-support Interaction; Interaction Effect; Metal-support Interactions; Methyl Mercaptans; Mn/sba-15; Si-o-mn; Sulfur Compounds; Manganese; Methyl Mercaptan; Oxygen Derivative; Ozone; Silicon; Sulfur; Thiol Derivative; Unclassified Drug; Volatile Organic Compound; Catalysis; Electron; Ozonation; Simulation; Adsorption; Article; Chemical Bond; Chemical Interaction; Electronic Metal Support Interaction; Oxidation; Physical Chemistry; Raman Spectrometry; Synthesis; Theoretical Study; Transmission Electron Microscopy","Catalyst activity; Electronic structure; Electrons; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Manganese; Ozone; Ozonization; Redox reactions; Silicon compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Active site; Catalytic ozonation; Catalytic performance; Coordination structures; Electronic metal-support interaction; Interaction effect; Metal-support interactions; Methyl mercaptans; Mn/SBA-15; Si-O-mn; Sulfur compounds; manganese; methyl mercaptan; oxygen derivative; ozone; silicon; sulfur; thiol derivative; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; catalysis; electron; ozonation; simulation; adsorption; Article; chemical bond; chemical interaction; electronic metal support interaction; oxidation; physical chemistry; Raman spectrometry; synthesis; theoretical study; transmission electron microscopy","","manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; ozone, 10028-15-6; silicon, 7440-21-3; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9; thiol derivative, 13940-21-1","The authors wish to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21876212, 21976214, 41603097, 21673086, and 52070195), Science and Technology Research Programs of Guangdong Province (No. 2019A1515011015), the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (No. 201904010353), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 19lgpy157) for financially supporting this work.

There has been tremendous progress in the technologies needed to address the concerns that conventional and novel water contaminants pose. Yet, to date, only a few relatively small DPR operations have been installed. As we get closer to the point where regulations are finalized and serious investments are planned, there is a need to ask: Are we ready? In this Review, we explore the technological, economic, and environmental considerations associated with DPR. In particular, we focus on the status of technologies for addressing the most challenging water pollutants, the cost estimates for DPR, and the energy demand and associated implications of DPR. We find that, although the technologies are nearly ready for DPR, the most critical issue will be real-time monitoring of a number of molecules that pose distinct challenges to advanced treatment trains. In addition, there is a need to consider emergency planning, both in terms of emergency buffer reservoir(s) and planning for situations in which the treated water does not meet specifications. Since any advanced treatment train will result in a significant increase in embedded energy, it will be particularly important to plan for renewable energy to minimize environmental impacts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging Pollutants; Monitoring; Reuse; Sensors; Water Quality","","","","","Haddeland, Ingjerd, Global water resources affected by human interventions and climate change, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 9, pp. 3251-3256, (2014); Papa, Matteo, How far are we from closing the loop of sewage resource recovery?

Catalytic oxidation has been verified as an efficient approach for VOCs elimination from industrial waste gas streams. Owing to the merits of cost-effective and high activity, cobalt-based catalysts have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for VOCs degradation. This review systematically summarized the developments achieved in the design of cobalt-based catalysts for VOCs removal over the past decade. Specifically, the fabrication of single cobalt oxides, cobalt-based binary oxides and cobalt-based composites, as well as the modified cobalt-based oxides by the surface engineering strategies, such as doping technology and acid etching method are coherently reviewed. Subsequently, the corresponding kinetic models and mechanisms are also discussed. Finally, considering the enormous challenges and opportunities in this field, the perspective with respect to future research on cobalt-based catalysts is proposed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Oxidation; Co-based Catalyst; Vocs","","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.21872096), the Educational Department of Liaoning Province (LZ2019002, LQ2020011)","Zhong, Jinping, Toluene oxidation over Co3+-rich spinel Co3O4: Evaluation of chemical and by-product species identified by in situ DRIFTS combined with PTR-TOF-MS, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 386, (2020); Wang, Xiuyun, Geometrical-Site-Dependent Catalytic Activity of Ordered Mesoporous Co-Based Spinel for Benzene Oxidation: In Situ DRIFTS Study Coupled with Raman and XAFS Spectroscopy, ACS Catalysis, 7, 3, pp. 1626-1636, (2017); Lei, Juan, Mesoporous Co3O4 Derived from Facile Calcination of Octahedral Co-MOFs for Toluene Catalytic Oxidation, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 59, 13, pp. 5583-5590, (2020); Liu, Zhao, Enhancement of propane combustion activity over CoO: X catalysts by introducing C2-C5diols, New Journal of Chemistry, 45, 19, pp. 8795-8805, (2021); Zhu, Wenjun, Manipulating morphology and surface engineering of spinel cobalt oxides to attain high catalytic performance for propane oxidation, Journal of Catalysis, 396, pp. 179-191, (2021); Jian, Yanfei, Efficient propane low-temperature destruction by Co3O4 crystal facets engineering: Unveiling the decisive role of lattice and oxygen defects and surface acid-base pairs, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 283, (2021); Ren, Quanming, 1D-Co3O4, 2D-Co3O4, 3D-Co3O4 for catalytic oxidation of toluene, Catalysis Today, pp. 160-167, (2019); Liu, Wei, Controllable synthesis of 3D hierarchical Co3O4 catalysts and their excellent catalytic performance for toluene combustion, Applied Surface Science, 507, (2020); Han, Weiliang, Morphology-Controlled Synthesis of the Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Nanorod Interweaved Lamellose Structure Co3O4 for Outstanding Catalytic Combustion Performance, Crystal Growth and Design, 19, 8, pp. 4546-4556, (2019); Zhao, Shuaiqi, Engineering Co3+-rich crystal planes on Co3O4 hexagonal nanosheets for CO and hydrocarbons oxidation with enhanced catalytic activity and water resistance, Chemical Engineering Journal, 420, (2021)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","27724433","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132784654"

Chemical oxidation technologies processes high efficiency on the destruction of aqueous organic components via oxidation by radicals, however, wood block treatment scenarios suffer from the low availability of radicals in aqueous conditions owing to the special structure of the wood blocks, limitations of mass transfer and the short life of free radicals. Herein, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is selected as a chelating agent to synthesize EDTA-Fe2+ chelate, thus introducing Fe2+ into the wood by vacuum impregnation. The Fe2+ is evenly distributed and immobilized in the wood to form a chemical oxidation system via in-situ activation of the dual oxidant (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-PS), which truncates the contact distance between free radicals and extractives/volatile oils thus enhancing the removal efficiency. Various controlling factors, including EDTA/Fe2+ molar ratio, Fe2+dosage, PS/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> molar ratio, and persulfate (PS) dosage are evaluated. The degradation products of VOCs by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) indicate that the wood VOC removal rate is ∼80%. The Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis further reveals that SO<inf>4</inf>−· and ·OH are the primary reactive species. The characterization of wood properties illustrates that the process has no destructive effect. The results of this work may provide a theoretical basis for feasibility of the practical application of the EDTA-Fe2+/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-PS system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual Oxidant; In-suit Chemical Oxidation (isco); Radicals; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Wood; Edetic Acid; Ferrous Ion; Hemicellulose; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Lignin; Phenanthroline; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxidants; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Chelation; Degradation; Efficiency; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Ethylene; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid; Free Radicals; Iron Compounds; Mass Spectrometry; Mass Transfer; Molar Ratio; Oxidants; Oxidation; Paramagnetic Resonance; Volatile Organic Compounds; Chemical Oxidation; Dual Oxidant; In-suit Chemical Oxidation; Oxidation Technology; Persulphate; Radical; Volatile Oil; Volatile Organic Compound; Wood Blocks; Gas Chromatography; Chelate; Edetic Acid; Essential Oil; Ferrous Ion; Free Radical; Hemicellulose; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Iron Chelate; Lignin; Phenanthroline; Volatile Organic Compound; Oxidizing Agent; Chelating Agent; Concentration (composition); Degradation; Edta; Oxidant; Oxidation; Pollutant Removal; Wood; Abts Radical Scavenging Assay; Air Pollution; Antioxidant Activity; Article; Binding Site; Biodegradability; Bioremediation; Chemical Reaction Kinetics; Contact Dermatitis; Cyclization; Dpph Radical Scavenging Assay; Electrochemical Analysis; Electron Spin Resonance; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; Eye Discomfort; Fatigue; Feasibility Study; Gas Chromatography; Human; Hydrophobicity; Infrared Spectroscopy; Iron Chelation; Mass Fragmentography; Mass Spectrometry; Methanogenesis; Multiple Sclerosis; Phytotoxicity; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Skin Irritation; Sneezing; Solid Phase Microextraction; Stoichiometry; Theoretical Study; Thermogravimetry; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Wettability; X Ray Diffraction; Chemistry; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Water Pollutant; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxidation-reduction; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wood","Chelation; Degradation; Efficiency; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Ethylene; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Free radicals; Iron compounds; Mass spectrometry; Mass transfer; Molar ratio; Oxidants; Oxidation; Paramagnetic resonance; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical oxidation; Dual oxidant; In-suit chemical oxidation; Oxidation technology; Persulphate; Radical; Volatile oil; Volatile organic compound; Wood blocks; Gas chromatography; chelate; edetic acid; essential oil; ferrous ion; free radical; hemicellulose; hydrogen peroxide; iron; iron chelate; lignin; phenanthroline; volatile organic compound; oxidizing agent; chelating agent; concentration (composition); degradation; EDTA; oxidant; oxidation; pollutant removal; wood; ABTS radical scavenging assay; air pollution; antioxidant activity; Article; binding site; biodegradability; bioremediation; chemical reaction kinetics; contact dermatitis; cyclization; DPPH radical scavenging assay; electrochemical analysis; electron spin resonance; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; eye discomfort; fatigue; feasibility study; gas chromatography; human; hydrophobicity; infrared spectroscopy; iron chelation; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; methanogenesis; multiple sclerosis; phytotoxicity; scanning electron microscopy; skin irritation; sneezing; solid phase microextraction; stoichiometry; theoretical study; thermogravimetry; transmission electron microscopy; wettability; X ray diffraction; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; water pollutant; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Wood","","edetic acid, 150-43-6, 60-00-4; ferrous ion, 15438-31-0; hemicellulose, 63100-39-0, 63100-40-3, 9034-32-6; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; lignin, 9005-53-2; phenanthroline, 12678-01-2; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxidants; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical","The authors are grateful to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 51779005/E090301 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (NO. 2021JD05 ).

Both adsorbent and ZrO<inf>2</inf> support were synthesized by the nanoreplication method using spherical silica as a template, whereas the Pt active phase was deposited by the polyol approach. Properties of the functional materials were studied by several techniques, including N<inf>2</inf> adsorption, SEM-EDS, TGA, XRD, XRF and XPS. It was shown that the inert silica separator played an essential role protecting the carbon adsorbent from undesirable partial oxidation. The highest possible effectiveness of the toluene removal (conversion of 94.5%) was obtained for the configuration with 150 mg of Pt/ZrO<inf>2</inf> per 40 mg of the adsorbent. A fair stability of the optimal dual-functional system was proved by performing five consecutive adsorption–desorption-oxidation cycles. The experimental study was complemented by energy demand calculations, which confirmed the superiority of the hybrid system over a classic catalytic flow reactor in terms of energy requirements for the desorption-oxidation step. It was demonstrated that the system might operate autothermally due to a substantial amount of generated heat. Additionally, a simplified dynamic mathematical model of the system was developed, which enabled the identification of key aspects, including directions towards more complex mathematical description, to be taken into account in further research aimed at optimization of the hybrid system. The proposed hybrid dual-functional system can therefore be a step forward in developing cost-effective elimination technologies of VOCs from lean waste gases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Catalytic Combustion; Energy Demand Calculations; Nanoreplication; Toluene; Vocs Removal; Adsorption; Carbon; Catalysis; Catalytic Oxidation; Cost Effectiveness; Desorption; Desulfurization; Energy Management; Functional Materials; Gases; Hybrid Systems; Silica Gel; Volatile Organic Compounds; Zirconia; Carbon Adsorbents; Catalytic Combustion; Catalytic System; Dual Functional System; Energy Demand Calculation; Energy Demands; Energy-balanced; Nanoreplication; Pt/zro 2; Volatile Organic Compound Removals; Toluene","Adsorption; Carbon; Catalysis; Catalytic oxidation; Cost effectiveness; Desorption; Desulfurization; Energy management; Functional materials; Gases; Hybrid systems; Silica gel; Volatile organic compounds; Zirconia; Carbon adsorbents; Catalytic combustion; Catalytic system; Dual functional system; Energy demand calculation; Energy demands; Energy-balanced; Nanoreplication; Pt/ZrO 2; Volatile organic compound removals; Toluene","","","The research has been funded from the Anthropocene Priority Research Area budget under the program ?Excellence Initiative - Research University? at Jagiellonian University.","Liang, Xiaoming, Reactivity-based industrial volatile organic compounds emission inventory and its implications for ozone control strategies in China, Atmospheric Environment, 162, pp. 115-126, (2017); Zhang, Kun, The impact of volatile organic compounds on ozone formation in the suburban area of Shanghai, Atmospheric Environment, 232, (2020); Handbook of Air Pollution from Internal Combustion Engines, (1998); Kampa, Marilena, Human health effects of air pollution, Environmental Pollution, 151, 2, pp. 362-367, (2008); Luxembourg, (2021); Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric Degradation of Volatile Organic Compounds, Chemical Reviews, 103, 12, pp. 4605-4638, (2003); Wang, Hailin, Characterization and assessment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions from typical industries, Chinese Science Bulletin, 58, 7, pp. 724-730, (2013); Li, Xiuquan, Adsorption materials for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the key factors for VOCs adsorption process: A review, Separation and Purification Technology, 235, (2020); Belaissaoui, Bouchra, Potentialities of a dense skin hollow fiber membrane contactor for biogas purification by pressurized water absorption, Journal of Membrane Science, 513, pp. 236-249, (2016); Ravi, Rajamanickam, Comparison of biological reactors (biofilter, biotrickling filter andmodified RBC) for treating dichloromethane vapors, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 85, 5, pp. 634-639, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","13858947","","CMEJA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119048581"

Two BTFs were used; BTF-A, a control bed, and BTF-B fed with rhamnolipids. The effect of empty bed residence times (EBRTs) on toluene bioavailability was investigated. Removal of toluene was carried out at EBRTs of 30 and 60 s and inlet loading rates (LRs) of 23–184 g m−3 h−1. At 30 s EBRT, when inlet LR was increased from 23 to 184 g m−3 h−1, the removal efficiency (RE) decreased from 93% to 50% for the control bed, and from 94% to 87% for BTF-B. Increasing the EBRT simultaneously with inlet LRs, confirms that BTF-A was diffusion-limited by registering a RE of 62% for toluene inlet LR of 184 g m−3 h−1, whereas BTF-B, achieved RE > 96%, confirming a significant improvement in toluene biodegradability. Overall, the best performance was observed at 60 s EBRT and inlet LR of 184 g m−3 h−1, providing a maximum elimination capacity (EC) of 176.8 g m−3 h−1 under steady-state conditions. While a maximum EC of 114 g m−3 h−1 was observed under the same conditions in the absence of rhamnolipids (BTF-A). Measurements of critical micelle concentration showed that 150 mg L−1 of rhamnolipids demonstrated the lowest aqueous surface tension and maximum formation of micelles, while 175 mg L−1 was the optimum dose for fungal growth.

In addition, automation is required to quantify active electrocatalysts in alkaline media and air pollution. In this study, N<inf>2</inf>O was removed sustainably by electrogenerated low valent nickel(I) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate [Ni(I)TSPc] in 1 M KOH using an electroscrubbing system. Ni(I)TSPc electro generation and N<inf>2</inf>O removal were automated by two (liquid/gas) electrochemical flow sensors, respectively. The Ni(I)TSPc was generated electrochemically up to 95% in 1 M KOH, and high removal efficiency (100%) was observed for 5 ppm N<inf>2</inf>O and 90% for 10 ppm N<inf>2</inf>O. A limiting potential change in the in-situ LSV of the chemically synthesized Ni(I)TSPc was taken and derived from the calibration plot and validated by an ex-situ potentiometric titration using an oxygen reduction potential electrode. Using the obtained calibration plot, electrogenerated Ni(I)TSPc allowed a direct determination in a liquid flow cell. The gas flow sensor developed using a KOH/Ni(II)CN<inf>4</inf> (TCN (II))-fabricated silver solid amalgam electrode showed an excellent response to N<inf>2</inf>O concentrations up to 32 ppm. A calibration plot with known concentration was derived and validated by gas chromatography. The response time and sensitivity obtained were approximately 500s and −0.012 mA ppm−1 cm−2, respectively. The sensor stability test confirmed its good stability. Finally, the developed in-situ electrochemical flow sensors were applied to the sustainable automation of N<inf>2</inf>O pollutant removal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automation; Electrochemical Flow Sensors; N2o Removal; Nickel Phthalocyanine Tetra Sulfonate; Silver Amalgam Electrode; Nickel; Nitrous Oxide; Oxygen; Phthalocyanine; Silver; Nickel; Amalgam; Nickel; Nitrous Oxide; Oxygen; Phthalocyanine; Silver; Calibration; Concentration (composition); Detection Method; Electrochemical Method; Electrode; Fuel Cell; Gas Flow; Performance Assessment; Pollutant Property; Pollutant Removal; Sensor; Temperature Effect; Air Pollutant; Article; Automation; Chronoamperometry; Electrochemical Analysis; Electrolysis; Energy Dispersive X Ray Spectroscopy; Environmental Monitoring; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Gas; Gas Chromatography; Limit Of Quantitation; Liquid Gas; Online Monitoring; Potentiometric Titration; Reaction Time; Room Temperature; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Thermal Conductivity; Validation Study; Waste Component Removal; Temperature; Electrodes; Nickel; Temperature","amalgam; nickel; nitrous oxide; oxygen; phthalocyanine; silver; calibration; concentration (composition); detection method; electrochemical method; electrode; fuel cell; gas flow; performance assessment; pollutant property; pollutant removal; sensor; temperature effect; air pollutant; Article; automation; chronoamperometry; electrochemical analysis; electrolysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental monitoring; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gas; gas chromatography; limit of quantitation; liquid gas; online monitoring; potentiometric titration; reaction time; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy; thermal conductivity; validation study; waste component removal; temperature; Electrodes; Nickel; Temperature","","nickel, 7440-02-0; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; oxygen, 7782-44-7; phthalocyanine, 574-93-6; silver, 7440-22-4; Nickel","This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Engineering Science and Technology (MEST) from the Korean Government (Grant No. NRF-2020R1H1A2009793 ).","Alam, Md Mahmud, Fabrication of phenylhydrazine sensor with V2O5 doped ZnO nanocomposites, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 243, (2020); Alam, Md Mahmud, Fabrication of dopamine sensor based on ternary AlMn0.645Cr1.76O7.47 nanoparticles, Materials Chemistry and Physics, 244, (2020); Aydin, Funda Armagan, Separation, preconcentration and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) determination of thorium(IV), titanium(IV), iron(III), lead(II) and chromium(III) on 2-nitroso-1-naphthol impregnated MCI GEL CHP20P resin, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 173, 1-3, pp. 669-674, (2010); Bañuelos, Jennifer A., Novel electro-fenton approach for regeneration of activated carbon, Environmental Science and Technology, 47, 14, pp. 7927-7933, (2013); Baytak, Sitki, Preconcentration of trace elements from water samples on a minicolumn of yeast (Yamadazyma spartinae) immobilized TiO2 nanoparticles for determination by ICP-AES, Talanta, 84, 2, pp. 319-323, (2011); Bollella, Paolo, Beyond graphene: Electrochemical sensors and biosensors for biomarkers detection, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 89, pp. 152-166, (2017); Borsdorf, Helko, Rapid on-site determination of chlorobenzene in water samples using ion mobility spectrometry, Analytica Chimica Acta, 440, 1, pp. 63-70, (2001); Bringmann, Jan C., Electrochemical mediators for total oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons: formation kinetics of Ag(II), Co(III), and Ce(IV), Journal of Applied Electrochemistry, 25, 9, pp. 846-851, (1995); Cai, Wei, Full automatic monitor for in-situ measurements of trace heavy metals in aqueous environment, Sensor Letters, 9, 1, pp. 137-142, (2011); Chen, Zhaopeng, An electrochemical amplification immunoassay using biocatalytic metal deposition coupled with anodic stripping voltammetric detection, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 129, 1, pp. 146-151, (2008)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10960953; 00139351","","ENVRA","34450160","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113643374"

Hence, this review elucidates the status, performances and limitations of two low-cost methods for biological treatment of hazardous sewage sludge, employing vermicomposting and black soldier fly larvae (BSFL). Their performances in terms of carbon recovery, nitrogen recovery, mass reduction, pathogen destruction and heavy metal stabilization were assessed alongside with the mature anaerobic digestion method. It was revealed that vermicomposting and BSFL were on par with anaerobic digestion for carbon recovery, nitrogen recovery and mass reduction. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion was found superior in pathogen destruction because of its high operational temperature. Anaerobic digestion also had proven its ability to stabilize heavy metals, but no conclusive finding could confirm similar application from vermicomposting or BSFL treatment. However, the addition of co-substrates or biochar during vermicomposting or BSFL treatment may show synergistic effects in stabilizing heavy metals as demonstrated by anaerobic digestion. Moreover, vermicomposting and BSFL valorization had manifested their potentialities as the low-cost alternatives for treating hazardous sewage sludge, whilst producing value-added feedstock for biochemical industries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofuel; Black Soldier Fly Larvae; Hazardous Sludge; Valorization; Vermicomposting; Carbon; Nitrogen; Metals, Heavy; Nitrogen; Sewage; Biofuels; Carbon; Costs; Developing Countries; Hazards; Heavy Metals; Metal Recovery; Nitrogen; Sewage Sludge; Sludge Digestion; Sludge Disposal; Anaerobics; Black Soldier Fly Larvae; Carbon Recovery; Hazardous Sludge; Investment Costs; Mass Reduction; Nitrogen Recovery; Performance; Valorisation; Vermi-composting; Anaerobic Digestion; Biodiesel; Biogas; Carbon; Nitrogen; Heavy Metal; Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Biochar; Composting; Incineration; Pathogen; Sewage; Sewage Disposal; Stabilization; Valorization; Article; Bacillales; Bacillus Cereus; Biomass Conversion; Biosolid; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Clostridiales; Comparative Study; Enterococcus Faecalis; Escherichia Coli; Fermentation; Hazardous Waste; House Fly; Insect Larva; Italy; Lactobacillales; Nonhuman; Organic Waste; Paenibacillus Polymyxa; Recycling; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Staphylococcus Aureus; Temperature; Vermicomposting; Anaerobic Growth; Hermetia Illucens; Anaerobiosis; Composting; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid","Biofuels; Carbon; Costs; Developing countries; Hazards; Heavy metals; Metal recovery; Nitrogen; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Sludge disposal; Anaerobics; Black soldier fly larvae; Carbon recovery; Hazardous sludge; Investment costs; Mass reduction; Nitrogen recovery; Performance; Valorisation; Vermi-composting; Anaerobic digestion; biodiesel; biogas; carbon; nitrogen; heavy metal; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; biochar; composting; incineration; pathogen; sewage; sewage disposal; stabilization; valorization; Article; Bacillales; Bacillus cereus; biomass conversion; biosolid; chemical oxygen demand; Clostridiales; comparative study; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; fermentation; hazardous waste; house fly; insect larva; Italy; Lactobacillales; nonhuman; organic waste; Paenibacillus polymyxa; recycling; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Staphylococcus aureus; temperature; vermicomposting; anaerobic growth; Hermetia illucens; Anaerobiosis; Composting; Metals, Heavy; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid","","carbon, 7440-44-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Metals, Heavy; Nitrogen; Sewage","Funding text 1: The financial supports from the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia via Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) with the cost center of 015MA0-110 ( FRGS/1/2020/TK0/UTP/02/20 ), HICoE-Center for Biofuel and Biochemical Research with the cost center of 015MA0-052 and Research Collaboration Grant UTP-UMP-UMT-UCTS with the cost center of 015MD0–019 are gratefully acknowledged.

Non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology has many advantages in the treatment of VOCs,such as low reactor treatment cost,simple reactor structure,simple operation,wide range of application,mild reaction conditions,which has received widespread attention in recent years. The experimental results show that the degradation of VOCs by single plasma has many problems such as O3,NO2 and organic by-products,which is easy to cause secondary pollution to the environment. The results show that the synergistic catalytic degradation of VOCs by low temperature plasma has significant effect on improving VOCs degradation rate,reducing energy consumption of reaction system and reducing harmful by-products. The NTP collaborative catalytic degradation of VOCs technology in detail was introduced,the influencing factors of NTP collaborative catalytic degradation of VOCs,the influence of different catalytic systems and discharge types on the degradation rate were summarized,and the mechanism of plasma technology and low temperature plasma co-catalytic degradation of VOCs was deduced. The synergistic effect of plasma technology and catalyst catalysis on VOCs degradation was described. Finally,the future development of this technology was prospected. The investigation shows that the current single processing technology is difficult to meet the VOCs processing requirements,a variety of technology coupling methods are widely used at home and abroad. In recent years,the combination of low-temperature plasma technology with catalytic technology plays a significant role in improving the degradation rate of VOCs,reducing the energy consumption of the reaction system and the generation of harmful by-products. This technology has feasibility and research value. At present,the research focuses on the degradation effect of pollutants by the combination mode of catalyst and low-temperature plasma,catalyst type,process parameters and other factors,but the research content is not in-depth. Plasma technology still has the disadvantages of low mineralization rate and many by-products,such as NOx,ozone and other by-products after plasma reaction,forming secondary pollution. In addition,due to the variety of active free radicals in the low-temperature plasma generated by gas discharge and the complex chemical reaction process of VOCs degradation,the synergistic mechanism of low-temperature plasma and catalysis is still unclear,especially the basic molecular dynamics theory of plasma degradation of VOCs remains to be further studied.Therefore,focusd on intrinsically safe and industrial applications,it is necessary to put forward a set of safety evaluation theory,method and tool which is suitable for process characteristics of low temperature plasma co-catalytic governance of VOCs. And it can be used to develop risk identification and risk evaluation for the whole process system,to identify potential safety hazard,and provide improvement measures,reduce the unreasonable choice and defect in the process design to the greatest extent,and achieves the goal of safe industrial application fundamentally. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Low Temperature Plasma; Molecular Dynamics; Safety Evaluation; Synergist; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs)","","","","","China Environment, (2017); Resources Economization Environmental Protection, (2016); Zhang, Zhaoshun, Non-thermal plasma-assisted NOx storage and reduction over cobalt-containing LNT catalysts, Catalysis Today, 258, pp. 386-395, (2015); Hinokuma, Satoshi, CO oxidation activity of thermally stable Fe-Cu/CeO2 catalysts prepared by dual-mode arc-plasma process, Catalysis Science and Technology, 5, 8, pp. 3945-3952, (2015); Mei, Danhua, Plasma-photocatalytic conversion of CO2 at low temperatures: Understanding the synergistic effect of plasma-catalysis, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 182, pp. 525-532, (2016); Cheminform, (2015); van Durme, Jim, Combining non-thermal plasma with heterogeneous catalysis in waste gas treatment: A review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 78, 3-4, pp. 324-333, (2008); Chen, Hsinliang, Removal of volatile organic compounds by single-stage and two-stage plasma catalysis systems: A review of the performance enhancement mechanisms, current status, and suitable applications, Environmental Science and Technology, 43, 7, pp. 2216-2227, (2009); Vandenbroucke, Arne M., Non-thermal plasmas for non-catalytic and catalytic VOC abatement, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 195, pp. 30-54, (2011); Neyts, Erik Cornelis, Plasma-Surface Interactions in Plasma Catalysis, Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 36, 1, pp. 185-212, (2016)","","China International Book Trading Corp.

Currently, noble metal-based catalysts are being replaced for other kinds of materials. In this study, three lanthanum-based perovskite-like oxides were synthesized (LaCo, LaCoMn, and LaMn) by the glycine-combustion method. The powder catalysts obtained were supported onto cordierite ceramic monoliths using an optimized washcoating methodology to obtain the subsequent monolithic catalysts (LaCo-S, LaCoMn-S, and LaMn-S). Sample characterization confirmed the formation of the perovskite-like phase in the powder materials as well as the presence of the perovskite phase after supporting it onto the monolithic structure. The XPS analysis showed a general decrease in lattice oxygen species for monolithic catalysts, mainly caused by the colloidal silica used as a binder agent during the washcoating process. Additionally, some variations in the oxidation state distribution for elements in Co-containing systems suggest a stronger interaction between cordierite and such catalysts. The catalytic activity results indicated that powder and monolithic catalysts were active for single-component VOC oxidation in the following order: 2-propanol > n-hexane≌ mixture > toluene, and there was no evidence of loss of catalytic activity after supporting the catalysts. However, LaMn-S had a better catalytic performance for all VOC tested under dry conditions, achieving oxidation temperatures between 230–420◦C. The oxidation efficiency for the VOC mixture was strongly affected by the presence of moisture linking the oxidation efficiency at wet conditions to the VOC chemical nature. Additionally, for higher VOC concentrations, the catalyst efficiency decreased due to the limited number of active sites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Monolithic Catalysts; Perovskite-like Oxides; Voc Abatement; Water Effect","","","","The authors thank Universidad de Antioquia, HATCH S.A.S, and COLCIEN-CIAS for the economic support given to this project (HATCH Project H295512).

We find that the catalyst prepared with manganese acetate (MnOx-Ac/PCS) exhibits the best catalytic performance with a T50 of 280 °C and a T90 of 302 °C, as well as the highest CO2 yield of 85.36%. The characterization techniques of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, EPR and TPR are used to reveal the structure-activity relationships of these PCS-supported MnOx catalysts. The results demonstrate that the excellent catalytic performance of MnOx-Ac/PCS is related to the abundant oxygen vacancy and higher content of adsorbed oxygen, which can quickly replenish the consumed lattice oxygen during the reaction. This work presents a new insight into the effect of different manganese precursors on the catalytic performance of MnOx catalysts.

The assistance of ozone has enabled efficient VOCs removal at low temperature. Thereby, catalytic ozonation is considered as one of the most feasible and effective methods for VOCs elimination. This work systematically reviews the emerging advances of catalytic ozonation of different VOCs (i.e., aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated VOCs, chlorinated VOCs, sulfur-containing VOCs, and saturated alkanes) over various functional catalysts. General reaction mechanism of catalytic ozonation including both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Mars-van-Krevelen mechanisms was proposed depending on the reactive oxygen species involving the reactions. The influence of reaction conditions (water vapor and temperature) is fully discussed. This review also introduces the enhanced VOCs oxidation via catalytic ozonation in the ozone-generating systems including plasma and vacuum ultraviolet. Lastly, the existing challenges of VOCs catalytic ozonation are presented, and the perspective of this technology is envisioned. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Ozonation; Low Temperature; Mno2; Plasma; Vocs; Vuv; Ozone; Ozone; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Manganese Oxide; Volatile Organic Compounds; Atmospheric Environment; Catalytic Ozonation; Human Being; Lows-temperatures; Mno$-2$; Voc Abatement; Voc Removal; Vocs Abatement; Vocs Removal; Vuv; Ozone; Ozone; Catalysis; Human; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Temperature; Water Pollutant; Catalysis; Humans; Oxidation-reduction; Temperature; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Manganese oxide; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric environment; Catalytic ozonation; Human being; Lows-temperatures; MnO$-2$; VOC abatement; VOC removal; VOCs abatement; VOCs removal; VUV; Ozone; ozone; catalysis; human; oxidation reduction reaction; temperature; water pollutant; Catalysis; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Temperature; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","ozone, 10028-15-6; Ozone; Water Pollutants, Chemical","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (No. 22076224 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2020A1515010865 ), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 20lgjc03 ), Open Fund of Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Air Pollution Control ( 2019323609–01 ) and the Key Laboratory of Water and Air Pollution Control of Guangdong province ( 2017A030314001 ).","Aghbolaghy, Mostafa, Role of Surface Carboxylates in the Gas Phase Ozone-Assisted Catalytic Oxidation of Toluene, Catalysis Letters, 147, 9, pp. 2421-2433, (2017); Aghbolaghy, Mostafa, Low Temperature Catalytic Oxidation of Binary Mixture of Toluene and Acetone in the Presence of Ozone, Catalysis Letters, 148, 11, pp. 3431-3444, (2018); Aghbolaghy, Mostafa, The role of surface carboxylates in catalytic ozonation of acetone on alumina-supported manganese oxide, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 128, pp. 73-84, (2017); Alimohammadi, Mahmood, Effectiveness of Ozone Gas on Airborne Virus Inactivation in Enclosed Spaces: A Review Study, Ozone: Science and Engineering, 43, 1, pp. 21-31, (2021); Alvares, A.

In this paper, influences of operating temperature distributions and internal flow fields on gas-out VOC concentration have been studied with experimental investigation and CFD numerical simulation. Experimental results shows that combustion temperature (around the combustor) plays more critical role than thermal storage bed temperature for affecting VOC flow-out concentration. By examining the internal flow and temperature distributions, modelling results demonstrate that fast heat transfer takes place in thermal ceramic beds and high temperature areas are formed around the combustor. At about 20 seconds after a bed working for gas-in flow, the heat transfer has demonstrated obvious attenuating. The research suggests that it is very challenging for simultaneously maintaining low gas-out VOC concentration and keeping low fuel consumption and low combustion temperature in RTOs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Voc Control Handbook; undefined, (2019); Zhang, Zhixiang, Low-temperature catalysis for VOCs removal in technology and application: A state-of-the-art review, Catalysis Today, 264, pp. 270-278, (2016); Sci Health A, (2010); Snyder, Robert A., Benzene's toxicity: A consolidated short review of human and animal studies by HA Khan, Human and Experimental Toxicology, 26, 9, pp. 687-696, (2007); Turner, Godfrey Alan, Values of Thermal (and Other) Parameters in Packed Beds, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Process Design and Development, 12, 4, pp. 417-424, (1973); Wakao, Noriaki, Particle-to-fluid transfer coefficients and fluid diffusivities at low flow rate in packed beds, Chemical Engineering Science, 31, 12, pp. 1115-1122, (1976); Aris, Rutherford, Some remarks on longitudinal mixing or diffusion in fixed beds, AIChE Journal, 3, 2, pp. 280-282, (1957); Abanto, Juan, On the design of the RTO unit using CFD, Applied Thermal Engineering, 26, 17-18, pp. 2327-2335, (2006); Gosiewski, Krzysztof, Aerodynamic CFD simulations of experimental and industrial thermal flow reversal reactors, Chemical Engineering Journal, 373, pp. 1367-1379, (2019)","Leung, S.W.","IOP Publishing Ltd","","2021 7th International Conference on Advances in Environment Research, ICAER 2021","","Sapporo, Virtual","176310","17551307; 17551315","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124014382"

Air pollutants can harm to the human respiratory system; alter the heart rate; enhance blood coagulation; and decrease lung function, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, lung cancer mortality, and cardiovascular problems. Therefore, air pollutants can be managed by using conventional physical and chemical technologies depending on the type of pollutants. Phytoremediation is an alternative method based on green technology that can decrease global warming and is environmentally friendly. Phytoremediation is a technology that uses plants to degrade organic pollutants and use them as a carbon source. In nature, plants are always associated with microorganisms, and they help each other to deal with pollutants by increasing hormones and antioxidant enzymes in the plant cell. Understanding of how plant-microbes remove the pollutants can be used to create an active living wall/botanical biofilter to solve the problem of air pollutants. In order to solve air pollution problems, forested areas should be created in the cities/industrial areas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollutants; Antioxidant; Hormone; Phytoremediation; Plant-microbe Interaction","","","","","Abts, Willem, The role of auxin-ethylene crosstalk in orchestrating primary root elongation in sugar beet, Frontiers in Plant Science, 8, (2017); Anderson, Hugh H.

The operation of WWTPs results in emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH<inf>4</inf>), mostly due to sludge anaerobic digestion. Amounts of emissions depend on the source of influent, i.e. municipal and industrial wastewater as well as sewer systems (gravity and rising). Wastewater is the fifth-largest source of anthropogenic CH<inf>4</inf> emissions in the world and represents 7–9% of total global CH<inf>4</inf> emissions into the atmosphere. Global wastewater CH<inf>4</inf> emission grew by approximately 20% from 2005 to 2020 and is expected to grow by 8% between 2020 and 2030, which makes wastewater an important CH<inf>4</inf> emitter worldwide. This review initially considers the emission of CH<inf>4</inf> from WWTPs and sewer networks. In the second part, biotechniques available for biodegradation of low CH<inf>4</inf> concentrations (<5% v/v) encountered in WWTPs have been studied. The paper reviews major bioreactor configurations for the treatment of polluted air, i.e. biotrickling filters, bioscrubbers, two-liquid phase bioreactors, biofilters, and hybrid reactor configurations, after which it focuses on CH<inf>4</inf> biofiltration systems. Biofiltration represents a simple and efficient approach to bio-oxidize CH<inf>4</inf> in waste gases from WWTPs. Major factors influencing a biofilter’s performance along with knowledge gaps in relation to its application for treating gaseous emissions from WWTPs are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofilter; Biological Treatment; Biotrickling Filter; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gas; Methane; Sewage; Two-liquid Phase Bioreactor; Waste Gas; Wastewater; Methane; Methane; Sewage; Waste Water; Anaerobic Digestion; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biogas; Biological Water Treatment; Bioreactors; Gas Emissions; Gas Plants; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Industrial Emissions; Industrial Water Treatment; Methane; Sewage; Sewage Pumping Plants; Wastewater Treatment; Bio-trickling Filters; Biological Treatment; Ch 4; Greenhouses Gas; Methane Concentrations; Sewer Networks; Two Liquid Phasis; Two-liquid Phase Bioreactor; Two-liquid-phase; Waste Gas; Biofilters; Methane; Acclimatization; Air Pollution; Anaerobic Digestion; Atmosphere; Biofiltration; Gas Waste; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gas; Human; Hybrid; Inoculation; Methane Emission; Moisture; Municipal Wastewater; Nutrient Content; Ph; Review; Temperature; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Bioreactor; Procedures; Sewage; Wastewater; Water Management; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification","Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biogas; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Industrial water treatment; Methane; Sewage; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Bio-trickling filters; Biological treatment; CH 4; Greenhouses gas; Methane concentrations; Sewer networks; Two liquid phasis; Two-liquid phase bioreactor; Two-liquid-phase; Waste gas; Biofilters; methane; acclimatization; air pollution; anaerobic digestion; atmosphere; biofiltration; gas waste; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; human; hybrid; inoculation; methane emission; moisture; municipal wastewater; nutrient content; pH; Review; temperature; waste water treatment plant; bioreactor; procedures; sewage; wastewater; water management; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Purification","","methane, 74-82-8; Methane; Sewage; Waste Water","Pr.

Likewise, the protection of the environment from the operation of the industrial facilities must meet the emission standards set by the authorities to obtain and maintain the License to Operate these industrial facilities. The prime focus of this chapter considers the Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) issues from a process point of view. This means that protecting personnel health is limited to a description of the major chemicals that the personnel can be exposed to. Thus, leaving it up to the refinery management to ensure that adequate procedures and protection measures to protect the health and well-being of their personnel during their working hours is enforced. Several cases of hazardous events in alumina refineries, including the bauxite residue storage area, introduces some of the process safety issues that have occurred in the past. From there, an introduction to Functional Safety is made representing a systematic approach to deal with this subject in today’s alumina refinery design and capacity expansions. Safety aspects of operating high pressure and temperature equipment in the digestion area are touched upon as well. Sources of the major gas borne emissions to the Environment from the alumina refinery operation within allowable local emission limits is discussed for NO<inf>x</inf>, CO, SO<inf>x</inf>, VOC, CO<inf>2</inf>, and particulate matter. Time has shown that authorities in general tend to tighten the allowable gas borne emissions to the environment and in many places rightfully so. Anticipating that this trend will continue in the future, it is important to understand current days technology with a view to future possibilities for acceptable solutions. In the near-term Natural Gas will be replacing HFO to lower SO<inf>x</inf> emissions and the “Carbon Footprint” of Alumina Refineries. In the medium-term, the ESP may be gradually outplaced with Fabric Filters (FF) or ESP/FF hybrids using “Tailor made” catalyst to reduce emissions of NO<inf>x</inf> and VOC’s and eliminate emissions of dust plumes when a power failure happens. In the long-term we may expect to see a gradual replacements of fossil fuels with “Green Hydrogen” to reduce the “Carbon Footprint” of future Alumina Refineries to almost ZERO. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Light Metals, (2009); Kotte, Jan J., BAYER DIGESTION AND PREDIGESTION DESILICATION REACTOR DESIGN., Light Metals: Proceedings of Sessions, AIME Annual Meeting (Warrendale, Pennsylvania), pp. 45-81, (1980); Light Metals, (2009); Prevention of Gas Related Explosions in Esps World Cem, (1993); Red Mud Pond Dam Failure at Ajka Hungary and Subsequent Developments Presentation at Icsoba Red Mud Seminar, (2011); 8th International Alumina Quality Workshop, (2008); Chem Eng, (2007); 8th International Alumina Quality Workshop, (2008); undefined; Chem Eng, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21962812; 0933033X","9783540236726; 9783642209420; 9783642234118; 9788132219392; 9788132211594; 9783642224829; 9781441999306; 9783642199707; 9783642235207; 9789400712287","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123633879"

The optimal heat-treatment temperature of the catalysts was shown to depend on the reactivity of the alkane studied. The catalytic activity of the Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalysts was found to be as high as that of the most effective catalysts based on noble metals. The physicochemical properties, from either the bulk (using XRD, TPR, TPD-O<inf>2</inf>, and TEM) or the surface (using XPS), of the catalysts were investigated to correlate the properties with the catalytic performance in the total oxidation of VOCs. The presence of S1 low-coordinated oxygen species at the near surface of the Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-based catalysts appeared to be linked with the higher reducibility of the catalysts and, consequently, with the higher catalytic activity, not only per mass of catalyst but also per surface area (enhanced areal rate). The co-presence of propane and methane in the feed at low reaction temperatures did not negatively affect the propane reactivity. However, the co-presence of propane and methane in the feed at higher reaction temperatures negatively affected the methane reactivity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alkane Oxidation; Cobalt Oxide; Ethane; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Methane; Propane; Surface Oxygen Vacancies; Total Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalysis; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cobalt Compounds; Ethane; Methane; Paraffins; Physicochemical Properties; Propane; Alkane Oxidation; Co 3o 4; Co-presence; Heat Treatment Temperature; Mixed Oxide; Simple++; Soft Chemistry Method; Surface Oxygen Vacancies; Total Oxidation; ]+ Catalyst; Volatile Organic Compounds","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cobalt compounds; Ethane; Methane; Paraffins; Physicochemical properties; Propane; Alkane oxidation; Co 3O 4; Co-presence; Heat treatment temperature; Mixed oxide; Simple++; Soft chemistry method; Surface oxygen vacancies; Total oxidation; ]+ catalyst; Volatile organic compounds","","","Funding: This research was funded by MINECO-Spain, grant number PRE2018-085211.

The degradation of toluene by the DBD plasma-catalytic method paid much attention. In this process, Mn-based catalysts with Ce, Co were recommendable. However, Mn-based composite catalyst to deal with toluene with DBD plasma-catalytic method, the by-product formation, optimal composition and service life are still not clear. In this work, Mn<inf>x</inf>Co<inf>y</inf>Ce<inf>z</inf>O<inf>n</inf> catalysts were prepared by the hydrothermal method. The physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts were analyzed. The removal efficiency and by-product analysis of toluene by the DBD plasma-catalytic method with Mn<inf>x</inf>Co<inf>y</inf>Ce<inf>z</inf>O<inf>n</inf> catalysts were investigated. It was found that Mn<inf>x</inf>Co<inf>y</inf>Ce<inf>z</inf>O<inf>n</inf> has a good crystalline phase composition, high amounts of chemisorbed and lattice oxygen.

This problem requires new techniques to reduce emissions by either improving the current emission control systems and processes or installing new hybrid treatment systems. These are of broad diversity, and every system has its advantages and disadvantages. The tendency is, accordingly, to combine various techniques to achieve more acceptable and suitable treatment. Recent studies suggest that the combination of photocatalysis and plasma in a reactor can offer attractive pollutant treatment efficiency with a minimum of partially oxidized by-products than that of these processes taken separately. However, there is little review of the capability of this pairing to treat different brands of pollutants. Besides, available data concerning reactor design with flows treated 10 to 1000 times higher than those studied at the lab scale. This review paid particular attention to determine the reaction mechanisms in terms of engineering and design of combination reactors (plasma and catalysis). Likewise, we developed the effect of critical parameters such as pollutant load, relative humidity, and flow rate to understand the degradation kinetics of specific pollutants individually by using plasma and photocatalysis. Additionally, this review compares different designs of cold plasma reactors combination with heterogeneous catalysis with special attention on synergistic and antagonistic effects of using plasma and photocatalysis processes at the laboratory, pilot, and industrial scales. Therefore, the elements discussed in this review stick well to the first theme on pollution prevention of the special issue concerning pollution prevention and the application of clean technologies to promote a circular (bio) economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Non-thermal Plasma; Photocatalysis; Process Extrapolation; Synergetic Effect; Air Pollutants; Environmental Pollutants; Air Pollution; Degradation; Emission Control; Environmental Regulations; Air Treatment; Current Emissions; Nonthermal Plasma; Photo-catalytic; Plasma Process; Pollutants Emissions; Pollution Prevention; Process Extrapolation; Recent Progress; Synergetic Effect; Photocatalysis; Atmospheric Pollution; Catalysis; Catalyst; Degradation; Emission Control; Oxidation; Plasma; Reaction Kinetics; Air Pollution; Antagonistic Effect; Article; Attention; Cold Stress; Degradation Kinetics; Drug Combination; Economic Aspect; Flow Rate; Human; Human Tissue; Photocatalysis; Plasma Gas; Pollutant; Reaction Analysis; Reactor Design; Relative Humidity; Air Pollutant; Kinetics; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Prevention And Control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Catalysis; Environmental Pollutants; Kinetics; Oxidation-reduction","Air pollution; Degradation; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Air treatment; Current emissions; Nonthermal plasma; Photo-catalytic; Plasma process; Pollutants emissions; Pollution prevention; Process extrapolation; Recent progress; Synergetic effect; Photocatalysis; atmospheric pollution; catalysis; catalyst; degradation; emission control; oxidation; plasma; reaction kinetics; air pollution; antagonistic effect; article; attention; cold stress; degradation kinetics; drug combination; economic aspect; flow rate; human; human tissue; photocatalysis; plasma gas; pollutant; reaction analysis; reactor design; relative humidity; air pollutant; kinetics; oxidation reduction reaction; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Catalysis; Environmental Pollutants; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction","","Air Pollutants; Environmental Pollutants","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia (by grant R.G.P. 1/257/42).

In this paper, the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf>) on the control of malodorous gases released from white water was investigated. The results showed that the released amount of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) decreased gradually with the increase of H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf> dosage. Specifically, the TVOC emission reached the minimum as the H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf> dosage was 1.5 mmol/L, and meanwhile, the hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf> S) and ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>) were almost completely removed. It was also found that pH had little effect on the release of TVOC as H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf> was added, but it evidently affect-ed the release of H<inf>2</inf> S and NH<inf>3</inf> . When the pH value of the white water was changed to 4.0 or 9.0, the emission of TVOC decreased slightly, while both H<inf>2</inf> S and NH<inf>3</inf> were completely removed in both cases. The ferrous ions (Fe2+) and the copper ions (Cu2+) were found to promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO•) out of H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf>, enhancing its inhibition on the release of malodorous gases from white water. The Fe2+ /H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf> system and Cu2+ /H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf> system exhibited similar efficiency in inhibiting the TVOC releasing, whereas the Cu2+ /H<inf>2</inf> O<inf>2</inf> system showed better perfor-mance in removing H<inf>2</inf> S and NH<inf>3</inf> . Application: This study shows that adding oxides to white water can control the release of malodorous gases. This has a positive effect on paper mills to limit the release of odor. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonia; Gases; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydrogen Sulfide; Iron Compounds; Metal Ions; Sulfur Determination; Volatile Organic Compounds; Copper Ions; Ferrous Ion; Human Health; Malodorous Gas; Papermaking Process; Ph Value; Total Volatile Organic Compounds; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; Wet-end; White Water; Oxidation; Gas; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydrogen Sulfide; Iron Compounds; Voc","Ammonia; Gases; Hydrogen peroxide; Hydrogen sulfide; Iron compounds; Metal ions; Sulfur determination; Volatile organic compounds; Copper ions; Ferrous ion; Human health; Malodorous gas; Papermaking process; pH value; Total volatile organic compounds; Volatile organic compound emission; Wet-end; White water; Oxidation; Gas; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hydrogen Sulfide; Iron Compounds; Voc","","","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (2017YFB0308301) and the Zhejiang Basic Public Welfare Research Project (LG - G18C160002).

Efficiencies, synergies and mechanisms of this combination were investigated by means of comprehensive quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Therefore, dry and wet synthetic air containing about 90 ppm of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) were treated with non-thermal plasma (NTP) and an intentionally undersized activated carbon (AC) filter, separately and in combination. As a result, removal of about 50 % was achieved for NTP or AC alone but a removal close to 95 % was found for the combination. Ozone, generated by the NTP, was reduced by 55 % with the AC-filter. For the operation of the NTP with humid air, a decomposition of the pollutant on AC was observed even after the plasma was switched off. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activated Carbon; Humidity; Methyl Ethyl Ketone; Non-thermal Plasma; Ozone","","","","","Almarcha, Daniel, Treatment Efficiency by means of a Nonthermal Plasma Combined with Heterogeneous Catalysis of Odoriferous Volatile Organic Compounds Emissions from the Thermal Drying of Landfill Leachates, Journal of Engineering (United Kingdom), 2014, (2014); Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric chemistry of VOCs and NO(x), Atmospheric Environment, 34, 12-14, pp. 2063-2101, (2000); Basner, Ralf, Effect of atmospheric surface plasma on the adsorption of ethanol at activated carbon filter element, Surface and Coatings Technology, 234, pp. 126-131, (2013); Brandenburg, Ronny, Plasma-Based Pollutant Degradation in Gas Streams: Status, Examples and Outlook, Contributions to Plasma Physics, 54, 2, pp. 202-214, (2014); undefined, (2020); Cal, Mark P., Removal of VOCs from humidified gas streams using activated carbon cloth, Gas Separation and Purification, 10, 2, pp. 117-121, (1996); Chang, Moo Been, Destruction and Removal of Toluene and MEK from Gas Streams with Silent Discharge Plasmas, AIChE Journal, 43, 5, pp. 1325-1330, (1997); Chen, J.

It was found that about half of the toluene carried by the air flow is retained only by absorption. The packed column electro-scrubber showed better performance in electrochemical degradation, while the jet mixing device showed the highest concentrations of toluene retained in the electrolyte/absorbent, reaching levels of supersaturation. The flow rate of the gas stream has a great influence on the efficiency of the electro-scrubbing system: the column appears to be more efficient at lower flow rates while the jet scrubber works better at higher flow rates.

They are involved in the formation of ozone, photochemical smog, and fine particles (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) in the atmosphere, which pose considerable threat to human healthy and ecosystem safety. The hybrid plasma-catalytic technology that uses non-thermal plasma (NTP) and catalysts is an efficient method for VOC abatement. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the removal of VOCs with this technology. First, the synergistic effects and mechanisms of NTP and catalysts are discussed. Then, the properties of the catalysts, including types, positions, and other parameters, are explored. Specific examples of VOCs abated using the NTP-catalyst technology are reviewed, along with the main types and the causes of by-products. Several methods, such as the optimization of process parameters and the utilization of end control, are considered efficient for the regulation of product formations. Finally, future perspectives on the applications of this hybrid technology are briefly discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","By-product; Non Thermal Plasma-catalyst; Synergistic Mechanism; Voc Abatement; Air Pollution; Catalysts; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalyst Technologies; Catalytic Technology; Future Perspectives; Hybrid Technology; Industrial Processs; Optimization Of Process Parameters; Photochemical Smog; Synergistic Effect; Plasma Applications","Air pollution; Catalysts; Volatile organic compounds; Catalyst technologies; Catalytic technology; Future perspectives; Hybrid technology; Industrial processs; Optimization of process parameters; Photochemical smog; Synergistic effect; Plasma applications","","","The authors appreciate the financial supports for this work from the National Key R and D Program of China (grant number 2019YFC0214403 ).

However, hydrophobic VOCs exhibit low removal, mainly due to their limited bioavailability for the microorganisms. Different strategies to enhance their removal in bio(trickling)filters have been developed with promising results. In this review, two strategies, i.e. the use of surfactants and hydrophilic compounds, for enhancing the removal of hydrophobic VOCs in bio(trickling)filters are discussed. The complexity of the processes and mechanisms behind both strategies are addressed to fully understand and exploit their potential and rapid implementation at full-scale. Mass transfer and biological aspects are discussed for each strategy, and an in-depth comparison between studies carried out over the last two decades has been performed. This review identifies additional strategies to further improve the application of (bio)surfactants and/or hydrophilic VOCs, and it provides recommendations for future studies in this field. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioavailability; Biofiltration; Co-metabolism; Kinetic Limitation; Mass Transfer Limitation; Surfactants; Vocs; Air Pollutants; Surface-active Agents; Volatile Organic Compounds; Biochemistry; Biofilters; Cost Effectiveness; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Mass Transfer; Surface Active Agents; Volatile Fatty Acids; Bio-trickling Filters; Biofiltrations; Biological Reactor; Co Metabolisms; Hydrophilic Compounds; Hydrophobics; Kinetic Limitations; Mass Transfer Limitation; Volatile Organics; Waste Gas Stream; Volatile Organic Compounds; Surfactant; Volatile Organic Compound; Bioavailability; Biofiltration; Chemical Compound; Complexity; Filter; Hydrophobicity; Literature Review; Pollutant Removal; Gas Waste; Hydrophilicity; Microorganism; Nonhuman; Review; Air Pollutant; Bioreactor; Chemical Phenomena; Filtration; Air Pollutants; Bioreactors; Filtration; Hydrophobic And Hydrophilic Interactions; Surface-active Agents; Volatile Organic Compounds","Biochemistry; Biofilters; Cost effectiveness; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Mass transfer; Surface active agents; Volatile fatty acids; Bio-trickling filters; Biofiltrations; Biological reactor; Co metabolisms; Hydrophilic compounds; Hydrophobics; Kinetic limitations; Mass transfer limitation; Volatile organics; Waste gas stream; Volatile organic compounds; surfactant; volatile organic compound; bioavailability; biofiltration; chemical compound; complexity; filter; hydrophobicity; literature review; pollutant removal; gas waste; hydrophilicity; microorganism; nonhuman; Review; air pollutant; bioreactor; chemical phenomena; filtration; Air Pollutants; Bioreactors; Filtration; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Surface-Active Agents; Volatile Organic Compounds","","Air Pollutants; Surface-Active Agents; Volatile Organic Compounds","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Ghent University through a special research grant (BOFSTG2019005701).

PCE was obtained by direct desorption from an aqueous solution containing 150 mg L−1, trying to a real pollution case. The electro-scrubber consisted of a packed absorption column connected with an undivided electrochemical cell. Diamond anodes supported on two different substrates (tantalum and silicon) were used and the results indicated that Ta/BDD was more successful in the production of Co (III) species and in the degradation of PCE. Three experimental systems were studied for comparison purposes: absorbent free of Co (III) precursors, absorbent containing Co (III) precursors, and absorbent containing Co (III) precursors undergoing previous electrolysis to the electro-scrubbing to facilitate the accumulation of oxidants. The most successful option was the last, confirming the important role of mediated electrochemical processes in the degradation of PCE. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl<inf>4</inf>) were found as the primary reaction products and ethyl chloroacetate esters were also identified.

Toluene retention in 3 h operation tests was higher than 87.0% in the case of treating the gaseous stream with single scrubbing, 97.0% in the case of using electro-scrubbing and over 99.0% in using cobalt-mediated electro-scrubbing. It was found that the amount of toluene that escapes from the electro-scrubber does not only depend on the flow rate but also on the current density and the presence of the metallic mediator. The higher the current densities are, the higher the amount of electrochemically degraded toluene is. In addition to the mediating effect of the metal catalyst, the results also suggest an important participation of the redox sulfate/persulfate pair in the degradation of toluene. Only methyl-cyclohexane (at very low concentrations) is observed as intermediate, despite carboxylic acids were also initially expected. The formation of this compound can be explained in terms of the hydrogenation of toluene.

In this study, a bench-scale biotrickling filter (BTF) packed with reticulated polyurethane sponge was evaluated for n-hexane removal at various organic loading rates (OLRs) (ranging from 15 to 60 g m−3 h-1) and gas empty bed contact times (EBCTs) (ranging from 30 to 7.5 s). The obtained results show that the designed BTF can effectively remove n-hexane under intermittent spraying mode of the nutrient solution and the reticulated configuration of the packing media, which resulted in the spatial development of mycelium and enhanced mass transfer of n-hexane. The mean maximum removal efficiencies (REs) of n-hexane were 92.6 ± 0.9 %, 86.7 ± 4.8 %, and 63.8 ± 3.3 % under the OLRs of 15.67, 30.20, and 61.59 g m−3 h-1, respectively. When the BTF was operated under gas EBCTs of 30, 15, and 7.5 s, average REs of 85.9 ± 5.7 %, 44.8 ± 6.3 %, and 31.2 ± 2.5 % were achieved. The BTF also showed a superior fluctuation resistance capability and prevented excessive biofilm accumulation due to the reticular configuration of the polyurethane sponge.

Compared to the non-thermal plasma (NTP) alone system, the degradation rate of toluene and CO2 selectivity improved significantly with the combination of plasma and photocatalysts, meanwhile, the CO selectivity and the by-products NO2 and O3 reduced.When the photocatalyst Ag-TiO2/γ-Al2O3 was packed into the discharge region,this plasma-photocatalytic system could completely remove toluene with above 81% CO2 selectivity and greatly reduced concentration of poisonous byproducts (O3 and NO2) at 5 kJ·L-1, while exhibiting superior stability. The energy efficiency of the hybrid system was increased by about 1.4-3 times, compared with the separated NTP. The main energy loss was the formation of by-products and the loss of light and heat. Finally, the intermediate products of the toluene degradation process of different catalyst systems were analyzed by GC-MS, and the mechanism of toluene degradation by the NTP-photocatalytic system was concluded.The process of NTP synergistic photocatalytic degradation of toluene mainly included three aspects: NTP degradation of toluene, photocatalytic oxidation degradation of toluene, and the synergistic effect between the two. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the study on the performance of VOCs degradation by NTP, and have certain guiding significance for the application and mechanism research of VOCs degradation by NTP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co2selectivity; Degradation Mechanism; Non-thermal Plasma; Photocatalyst; Toluene; Aluminum Compounds; Biodegradation; Carbon Dioxide; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Electric Discharges; Energy Dissipation; Energy Efficiency; Hybrid Systems; Nitrogen Oxides; Photocatalysts; Sol-gels; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Ag-tio2; Co2 Selectivity; Co2selectivity; Degradation Mechanism; Energy; Nonthermal Plasma; Performance; Photocatalytic Systems; Toluene Degradations; ]+ Catalyst; Degradation","Aluminum compounds; Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Hybrid systems; Nitrogen oxides; Photocatalysts; Sol-gels; Titanium dioxide; Toluene; Ag-TiO2; CO2 selectivity; CO2selectivity; Degradation mechanism; Energy; Nonthermal plasma; Performance; Photocatalytic systems; Toluene degradations; ]+ catalyst; Degradation","","","This study was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China ( 21505156 ); the Shandong Nature Science Foundation of China ( ZR2020MA104 ); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 19CX02039A ).

Nevertheless, a systematic summary regarding the characteristics, sampling detection, and control technology for odor emissions from livestock farms is currently lacking. This paper compares the development of odor standards in different countries and summarizes the odor emission characteristics of livestock farms. Ammonia, the most common odor substance, can reach as high as 4100 ppm in the compost area. Sampling methods for point and area source odor emissions are introduced in this paper, and odor analysis methods are compared. Olfactometers, odorometers, and the triangle odor bag method are usually used to measure odor concentration. Odor control technologies are divided into three categories: physical (activated carbon adsorption, masking, and dilution diffusion), chemical (plant extract spraying, wet scrubbing, combustion, non-thermal plasma, and photocatalytic oxidation), and biological (biofiltration, biotrickling, and bioscrubbing). Each technology is elucidated, and the performance in the removal of different pollutants is summarized.

Conventionally, many technologies are in practice for constricting their escape to the environment. However, due to associated adverse health hazards, more efficient technique ensuring complete mineralization is inevitably demanded. In the current study, the degradation of toluene by post-plasma catalysis using cobalt-coupled (Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>–CoO) catalyst was studied. Firstly, a new starch-assisted synthesis route for cobalt coupling is presented. Secondly, the research finding of this study showed that the formed cobalt couple exhibited robust performance for toluene degradation up to 99%, which was attributed to their enhanced redox property and adsorbed oxygen content. This promotion in catalytic ability is due to intrinsically greater oxygen storage capacity of coupling. Additionally, the results of this study indicated that toluene degradation was increased significantly with higher input power, whereas, without catalyst application, nonthermal plasma (NTP) alone produced other VOCs as a result of toluene degradation and higher NO concentration at high input power and higher O<inf>3</inf> at low input power. Furthermore, it could be concluded that NTP along with cobalt-coupled catalyst promotes toluene degradation, controls the production of all other VOCs and O<inf>3</inf> and significantly reduced the production of NO concentration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst; Nonthermal Plasma; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Gas; Biodegradation; Catalysts; Health Hazards; Mineralogy; Oxygen; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Ability; Cobalt Oxide Catalysts; Environmental Matrixes; Industrial Utilization; Nonthermal Plasma; Oxygen Storage Capacity; Robust Performance; Toluene Degradations; Cobalt Compounds","Biodegradation; Catalysts; Health hazards; Mineralogy; Oxygen; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic ability; Cobalt oxide catalysts; Environmental matrixes; Industrial utilization; Nonthermal plasma; Oxygen storage capacity; Robust performance; Toluene degradations; Cobalt compounds","","","This research is based on the work supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51778229).","Zhu, Xinbo, Post-plasma catalytic removal of methanol over Mn-Ce catalysts in an atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 183, pp. 124-132, (2016); Liu, Gaoyuan, UV/H2O2: An efficient aqueous advanced oxidation process for VOCs removal, Chemical Engineering Journal, 324, pp. 44-50, (2017); Yao, Xiaohong, Plasma-catalytic removal of toluene over the supported manganese oxides in DBD reactor: Effect of the structure of zeolites support, Chemosphere, 208, pp. 922-930, (2018); Omran, H.

The photocatalytic performance was evaluated for 42 VOCs at ppb and sub-ppb concentrations and the photocatalytic kinetic constant for abatement k was measured for each specific compound. An overall value of k was also obtained for the sum of all quantified VOCs. The kinetic constant k allows to predict the time needed to abate the substrate down to the desired residual concentration and to define the correct sanitization protocol. The kinetic constant k depends on the effective concentration in accordance with the basic kinetic model already reported for the photocatalytic process. This model foresees the transformation rate of a substrate as a function of a bundle of microscopic kinetic constants, the concentration of the substrate at the surface and the adsorbed photon flux. From this model it was possible i) to correlate the k value with microscopic catalytic parameters and the VOC concentration; ii) to obtain useful suggestions for the standardization of test methods on gaseous pollutants. Clear indications were also obtained on the actual ability of photocatalytic devices to abate urban VOCs. Since many of them are quickly degradable and some fully halogenated hydrocarbons found in urban air are not, this research can also help to decide which organic compounds are suitable for standardization testing or to use a mixture of a majority of them. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air/solid Interface; Clean Air Delivery Rate (cadr); Cstr; Photocatalytic Air Cleaner; Standardization; Volatile Organic Compounds (voc); Acetaldehyde; Air Pollutants; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds; Fog; Rate Constants; Standardization; Testing; Continuous-flow Stirred Tank Reactors; Effective Concentration; Environmental Concentration; Halogenated Hydrocarbons; Photocatalytic Devices; Photocatalytic Performance; Photocatalytic Process; Residual Concentrations; Kinetics; Acetaldehyde; Halogenated Hydrocarbon; Volatile Organic Compound; Adsorption; Catalyst; Photodegradation; Reaction Kinetics; Standardization; Substrate; Air Pollutant; Ambient Air; Article; Catalysis; Concentration Process; Effective Concentration; Fourier Transform Infrared Photoacoustic Spectroscopy; Gas; Kinetic Parameters; Kinetics; Microscopy; Photocatalysis; Photon; Solid; Substrate Concentration; Urban Area; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds","Fog; Rate constants; Standardization; Testing; Continuous-flow stirred tank reactors; Effective concentration; Environmental concentration; Halogenated hydrocarbons; Photocatalytic devices; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic process; Residual concentrations; Kinetics; acetaldehyde; halogenated hydrocarbon; volatile organic compound; adsorption; catalyst; photodegradation; reaction kinetics; standardization; substrate; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; catalysis; concentration process; effective concentration; Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy; gas; kinetic parameters; kinetics; microscopy; photocatalysis; photon; solid; substrate concentration; urban area; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; Air Pollutants; Gases; Volatile Organic Compounds","The authors are kindly grateful for the financial support to Università di Torino (Ricerca Locale), and Varya s.r.l (Torino).","Ao, Chio Hang, Enhancement effect of TiO2 immobilized on activated carbon filter for the photodegradation of pollutants at typical indoor air level, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 44, 3, pp. 191-205, (2003); Barbeni, Massimo, Photodegradation of pentachlorophenol catalyzed by semiconductor particles, Chemosphere, 14, 2, pp. 195-208, (1985); Calza, Paola, Photocatalytically assisted hydrolysis of chlorinated methanes under anaerobic conditions, Environmental Science and Technology, 31, 8, pp. 2198-2203, (1997); Calza, Paola, Photocatalytic transformations of chlorinated methanes in the presence of electron and hole scavengers, Journal of the Chemical Society - Faraday Transactions, 93, 21, pp. 3765-3771, (1997); Carey, John H., Photodechlorination of PCB's in the presence of titanium dioxide in aqueous suspensions, Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, 16, 6, pp. 697-701, (1976); Photocatalysis Continuous Flow Test Methods Part 1 Determination of the Degradation of Nitric Oxide no in the Air by Photocatalytic Materials, (2016); undefined, (2017); Cincinelli, Alessandra, Indoor air quality and health, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14, 11, (2017); Costarramone, Nathalie, Efficiency and harmfulness of air-purifying photocatalytic commercial devices: From standardized chamber tests to nanoparticles release, Catalysis Today, 252, pp. 35-40, (2015); Dibble, Lynette A., Kinetics of the gas-solid heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of trichloroethylene by near UV illuminated titanium dioxide, Catalysis Letters, 4, 4-6, pp. 345-354, (1990)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00456535; 18791298","","CMSHA","33485036","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099632869"

In the course of the experiments, it was shown that the efficiency of the decomposition of carbon tetrachloride in DBD can reach 100%. Depending on the conditions of the experiments, the effective rate constants were equal to (0.16–0.59) s−1, and the decomposition energy yields were (0.001–0.012) molecules per 100 eV of the inputed energy. The main decomposition products were CO<inf>2</inf> and Cl<inf>2</inf> molecules. The formation of a solid on the internal electrode of the reactor was also found. The substance contains atoms of carbon, oxygen, chlorine (C:O:Cl) = 1:0.38:0.01, as well as hydrogen atoms.

Oxidation by microwave-activated persulfate (MW-PS) is a promising alternative method that has been used to eliminate VOCs from wood. The penetration of microwave energy can destroy the wood pit membranes and increase VOC emissions. The VOCs are further degraded by ·OH and SO4-, which are generated via the activation of microwaves. This phenomenon can be detected by the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. The 35 types of main VOCs of natural wood were determined, including alkanes/terpenes, alcohols/ethers, esters, aldehydes/ketones, and others. In the MW-PS system, 23 compounds were removed with an efficiency of 100%.

Therein, analyte selectivity in complex gas mixtures like breath or indoor air remains the major challenge. Filters are an effective and versatile, though often unrecognized, route to overcome selectivity issues by exploiting additional properties of target analytes (e.g., molecular size and surface affinity) besides reactivity with the sensing material. This review provides a tutorial for the material engineering of sorption, size-selective and catalytic filters. Of specific interest are high surface area sorbents (e.g., activated carbon, silica gels and porous polymers) with tunable properties, microporous materials (e.g., zeolites and metal-organic frameworks) and heterogeneous catalysts, respectively. Emphasis is placed on material design for targeted gas separation, portable device integration and performance.

Although the suggested model was built based on simplified kinetic assumptions, it can reasonably predict the behavior of extracellular MCs in a harvested/concentrated slurry of microalgae taken from a blooming site. After 24 h of NTP treatment, the experimental reduction of extracellular MCs was recorded up to ∼77 %. Regressions based on the experimental data reveal the degradation rate (8.60 d−1) and release rate (0.37 d−1) of MCs, which provides the essential physicochemical information about intracellular MCs release by microalgal cell destruction. Simulation results help to develop safe and useful control over the simultaneous treatment of harvested microalgal biomass and toxins. This study further demonstrates that the suggested model contributes to predicting the variation of MCs in mass management of microalgal biomass for sustainable utilization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Degradation Kinetics; Intracellular Microcystin; Mathematical Modeling; Microalgal Bloom; Non-thermal Plasma; Microcystin Lr; Microcystin Rr; Microcystins; Plasma Gases; Algae; Biomass; Degradation; Microorganisms; Cell Destruction; Degradation Rate; Extracellular; Microalgal Biomass; Nonthermal Plasma; Release Rate; Simultaneous Removal; Sustainable Utilization; Forecasting; Microcystin; Microcystin Lr; Microcystin Rr; Microcystin Yr; Unclassified Drug; Biomass; Detection Method; Experimental Study; Oxidation; Pollutant Removal; Toxin; Algal Bloom; Article; Bioremediation; Cell Destruction; Decomposition; Degradation Kinetics; Feasibility Study; Mathematical Model; Microalga; Microbial Biomass; Nonhuman; Physical Chemistry; Plasma Gas; Prediction; Simulation; Metabolism; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Microalgae; Microcystins; Oxidation-reduction; Plasma Gases","Algae; Biomass; Degradation; Microorganisms; Cell destruction; Degradation rate; Extracellular; Microalgal biomass; Nonthermal plasma; Release rate; Simultaneous removal; Sustainable utilization; Forecasting; microcystin; microcystin LR; microcystin RR; microcystin YR; unclassified drug; biomass; detection method; experimental study; oxidation; pollutant removal; toxin; algal bloom; Article; bioremediation; cell destruction; decomposition; degradation kinetics; feasibility study; mathematical model; microalga; microbial biomass; nonhuman; physical chemistry; plasma gas; prediction; simulation; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Microalgae; Microcystins; Oxidation-Reduction; Plasma Gases","","microcystin LR, 101043-37-2; microcystin RR, 111755-37-4; Microcystins; Plasma Gases","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2017R1A2B4012762), and Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as Knowledge-based environmental service (Waste to energy) Human resource development Project.

In fact, the samples with higher P-contents decrease their performances at longer TOS, likely due to the surface deposition of carbon-like molecules. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethylene Oxidation; Gas Chromatography Analysis; Phosphorus-based Titania; Photocatalysis; Photocatalytic Reaction Mechanism; Titania Nanoparticles; Titania-based Photocatalysts; Uv Sources; Uv-simulated Reactions; Vocs Abatement","","","","","Off J Eur Comm L85 1l85 22, (1999); Li, Weibin, Catalytic combustion of VOCs on non-noble metal catalysts, Catalysis Today, 148, 1-2, pp. 81-87, (2010); Ojala, Satu Anneli, Catalysis in VOC abatement, Topics in Catalysis, 54, 16-18, pp. 1224-1256, (2011); Olsen, Erik, Predicting vapour pressures of organic compounds from their chemical structure for classification according to the VOC-directive and risk assessment in general, Molecules, 6, 4, pp. 370-389, (2001); Kamal, Muhammad Shahzad, Catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - A review, Atmospheric Environment, 140, pp. 117-134, (2016); Doggali, Pradeep, Combustion of volatile organic compounds over Cu-Mn based mixed oxide type catalysts supported on mesoporous Al 2O 3, TiO 2 and ZrO 2, Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 358, pp. 23-30, (2012); Carpentier, J., Characterisation of Mg/Al hydrotalcite with interlayer palladium complex for catalytic oxidation of toluene, Applied Catalysis A: General, 234, 1-2, pp. 91-101, (2002); Khan, Faisal I., Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds from polluted air, Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 13, 6, pp. 527-545, (2000); Pozan, Gülin Selda, Total oxidation of toluene over metal oxides supported on a natural clinoptilolite-type zeolite, Chemical Engineering Journal, 162, 1, pp. 380-387, (2010); Öztürk, Bahtiyar, Absorptive removal of volatile organic compounds from flue gas streams, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 84, 5 B, pp. 391-398, (2006)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783030589349; 9783030589332","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149432196"

The catalytic activity and selectivity through the possible formation of by-products during the NTP discharge for the abatement of irreversibly adsorbed toluene have been investigated by FT-IR and mass spectrometer. The regeneration of the used Hopcalite by NTP discharge has been established by (i) determining the amount of toluene adsorbed on NTP regenerated Hopcalite, (ii) investigating the catalytic activity of NTP regenerated Hopcalite and (iii) comparing the bulk and surface properties of the fresh calcined and NTP regenerated Hopcalite. The ratio of amount of irreversibly adsorbed toluene to that of the total amount of adsorbed toluene adsorbed is similar for the fresh calcined and NTP (I) regenerated Hopcalite. The catalytic activity of the NTP (I) regenerated Hopcalite is slightly enhanced when compared to that of the fresh calcined Hopcalite. Although the first NTP treatment induces partial transformation of Hopcalite into Mn<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> with no detected related CuO<inf>x</inf> and reduces specific surface area by a factor of 2, the toluene adsorption capacity remains less affected.

There have been tremendous strides toward the understanding of elicitors, biosynthesis and ecological functions, and factors affecting the plant volatile emissions in insect-plant interactions. Recent research has focused on the use of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) for the management of biotic stresses plants. The changing climate also calls for a focus on the impact of adverse climatic factors on volatile emissions and their role in plant defense. The work done in this area is broadly discussed with a focus on the biosynthetic pathways; constitutive and induced emissions from leaves, flowers, and roots; their effect on herbivores, natural enemies, and hyperparasitoids; applications in pest management; prospects of genetic manipulation of volatile emission; status of work done in the rice crop; the impact of elevated temperature, CO2, and ozone on volatile emissions; and the negative impacts of manipulating HIPVs.

Many biogenic as well as anthropogenic sources are responsible for the emission of VCs. In 2014, the National Emissions Inventory reported that vegetation and soil emitted biogenic VCs, among all other sources, contributed around 70% in the US. Biogenic VCs are of immense value for the development of ecosystems. Volatile metabolites produced by the microbial and/or plant metabolism can be differentiated into inorganic and organic molecules. The emission of VCs from various plant parts, viz., leaves, flowers, and roots, is a constitutive process. Exposure of plants to abiotic as well as biotic stresses enhances this emission of VCs. The rate of release of VCs differs between community levels genotypes, with the age of the plant and season, and even from leaf to leaf. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Añón, J.

The continuous addition of hazardous chemicals, gaseous contaminants, and particulate materials to our environment imposed the life-threatening challenges for flora and fauna. There is an urgent need to adopt the sustainable technologies to reduce the contamination occurring in air and water resources. To cope up with various types of contaminants abatement techniques have been employed. In the recent decade the biofiltration-based methods have been emerged as promising abatement techniques to remove the hazardous contaminants from wastewater or polluted air. The biofiltration exploits the potentials of microbial systems (bacteria and fungi) to degrade the wide range of chemicals and volatile organic components (VOCs). In this chapter emphasis has been given on the basic concepts and mechanism of biofiltration along with its application for treatment of wastewater and polluted air. The details about the removals of hazardous heavy metals, cationic-anionic dyes, xenobiotics, organic contaminants, and assimilable organic carbon from water has been discussed. The removal of VOC, malodorous compounds, and sulfurous compound from air have been discussed. The chapter also gives the light about pros and cons of biofiltration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abatement Techniques; Assimilable Organic Carbon; Biofiltration; Volatile Organic Components; Xenobiotics","","","","","Añón, J.

It is shown that methods for capturing emissions from metallurgical dust are still based on the use of inertial and electrostatic forces and a filtration method. The greatest cleaning effect is provided by cloth filters and electrostatic precipitators. Currently, there are filter materials for high-temperature gas purification (up to 1000˚C), and electrostatic precipitators that allow capturing highly dispersed particles. Improvement of wet apparatuses is moving towards the creation of high-pressure scrubbers and centrifugal apparatus that provide cooling and purification of gases from submicron dust and gaseous toxins. It is shown that at present there are various methods of gas purification from organic and inorganic toxins based on the phenomena of sorption, oxidation and reduction in the presence of catalysts and without them, as well as under electronic, light and radiation exposure. When choosing devices for cleaning metallurgical emissions, preference should be given to those in which the processes of capturing dust and toxic gases are combined. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofiltration; Catalytic; Dust; Dust Cleaning; Emissions; Gas Cleaning; Metallurgical Processes; Organic And Inorganic Toxic Substances; Photolytic; Plasma-chemical Cleaning Methods; Sorption","","","","","Añón, J.

Plasma catalysis is now facing a rapid growth phase after a long, gradual period of growth over several decades. This interim report aims to analyze the progress of plasma catalysis over the last two decades and provide some future challenges. For readers who are laymen in this field, a brief explanation of plasma catalysis is provided in the introduction. The first part of the interim report addresses five important matching issues for plasma and one for catalyst. We also collectively present experimental evidence in the literature that underpins the interaction of plasma with a catalyst that is directly inserted into the plasma zone. We also emphasize on synergy, which is sometimes mistreated by neglecting the heating effect under a high energy input. In the second part of this report, we discuss recent achievements. A brief review of the historical development of plasma reactors from a packed-bed to a honeycomb discharge, which is suitable for large-scale applications, is provided. In the final part, some blueprints for future challenges are delineated based on the experimentally observed evidence from macro-to nano-and atomic-scale measurements. Developing effective catalysts capable of utilizing vibrationally excited hot molecules will be key for forthcoming innovations in plasma catalysis. We also underline the importance of implementing new sets of materials (both metals and supports) by introducing recent notable examples in conventional catalysis. The interlink between computational works on the macro/micro-scale and molecular/atomic-scale will be an interesting task in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Matching; Operando Measurement; Plasma Catalysis; Reactor Design; Synergy; Vibrational Excitation","","","","This work was supported by JST CREST (JPMJCR19R3) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP18H01208.","Bogaerts, Annemie A.M.B., The 2020 plasma catalysis roadmap, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 53, 44, (2020); Añón, J.

To reduce anthropogenic emissions, it is necessary to improve existing techniques, e.g., catalytic oxidation through the development of new cost-effective catalysts. To assess the viability of catalytic oxidation for industrial applications, further tests are required, including mixture tests at intermediate scale in relevant environment and extrapolated on an industrial scale. The catalytic performance of a new mixed oxide Co-Al-Ce was studied towards the oxidation of the n-butanol and toluene on a semi-pilot scale (TRL 4). Single component and mixture experiments were performed for several concentrations at a fixed flow rate. A commercial catalyst Pd/&gamma;-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> was employed as the benchmark to evaluate the performance of the mixed oxide. The Co-Al-Ce catalyst enabled complete oxidation of n-butanol at the same temperature as the reference catalyst. Also, the catalyst demonstrated a better selectivity for n-butanol, while providing an equivalent one for the oxidation of toluene. In mixtures, the presence of n-butanol promotes the oxidation of toluene for both catalysts but more significantly for the Co-Al-Ce catalyst. The presence of toluene inhibited the oxidation of n-butanol for the Co-Al-Ce and promotes it for high conversions of n-butanol for the Pd/&gamma;-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Oxidation; Mixed Oxide; Semi-pilot Scale; Voc Abatement; Aluminum Alloys; Benchmarking; Catalysts; Cerium Alloys; Cobalt Alloys; Cost Effectiveness; Mixtures; Oxidation; Ternary Alloys; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Anthropogenic Emissions; Catalytic Performance; Commercial Catalyst; Complete Oxidation; Development And Testing; Mixture Experiment; Oxidation Of Toluenes; Reference Catalyst; Catalytic Oxidation","Aluminum alloys; Benchmarking; Catalysts; Cerium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cost effectiveness; Mixtures; Oxidation; Ternary alloys; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Anthropogenic emissions; Catalytic performance; Commercial catalyst; Complete oxidation; Development and testing; Mixture experiment; Oxidation of toluenes; Reference catalyst; Catalytic oxidation","","","The authors thank the Walloon Region and the European Union for financial support through an Interreg V DepollutAir France‐Wallonie‐Vlaanderen project ‐ N° 1.1.18 ‐ GoToS3.","Öztürk, Bahtiyar, Absorptive removal of volatile organic compounds from flue gas streams, Process Safety and Environmental Protection, 84, 5 B, pp. 391-398, (2006); Añón, J.

However, there is a paucity of information on the mechanisms of oxidation of various air pollutants by different photocatalytic materials. In this review, we describe the photocatalytic applicabilities of both TiO<inf>2</inf>- vs. non-TiO<inf>2</inf>-based materials against various target pollutants that cover a list of important organic (e.g., formaldehyde, toluene, benzene, phenol, and trichloroethene) and inorganic compounds (e.g., nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and ozone). The performance of different photocatalytic systems has been evaluated based on the general performance metrics such as quantum yield (QY) and space time yield (STY). The magnitude of QY is generally higher for the removal of organic than inorganic compounds. Among the compiled photocatalysts, Fe/TiO<inf>2</inf> catalysts with 0.11% Fe recorded the maximum STY of 1.21×10−7 molecules/photon/mg (and QY = 6.06×10−6 molecules/photon) for NOx of all listed inorganic species.

The influence of UV irradiation length on the removal rate and byproducts were compared. The results show that the toluene removal is obviously improved in the CPP reactor. The removal rate is enhanced with the increase of the UV irradiation length. The increase of removal efficiency is 7.94% and 19.1% under the UV irradiation with 5 cm and 15 cm length, respectively. UV also reduces the production of ozone significantly. It is interesting to find that the effect of UV on the carbon balance is not always increased as expected, but is related to the inlet toluene initial concentration. When the inlet toluene concentration is 300 ppm or 400 ppm, the carbon balance is enhanced by UV. When the inlet concentration is lower, in 60 ppm and 100 ppm, UV no longer plays a positive role. However, UV can change the trend of carbon balance at low initial concentrations and makes it positively related to specific input energy (SIE), which is contrary to the cases without UV. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Balance; Cpp; Uv; Vocs Degradation; Carbon; Photolysis; Toluene; Carbon Balance; Initial Concentration; Inlet Concentration; Removal Efficiencies; Removal Rate; Specific Input Energies; Toluene Decomposition; Uv Irradiation; Irradiation","Carbon; Photolysis; Toluene; Carbon balance; Initial concentration; Inlet concentration; Removal efficiencies; Removal rate; Specific input energies; Toluene decomposition; UV irradiation; Irradiation","","","This work was supported financially by special fund for basic scientific research in central colleges and universities of China (2232017D-25).

Models are the key tools used to understand these changes, and these underscore that there are many processes important in controlling the tropospheric ozone budget. In this critical review, we assess our evolving understanding of these processes, both physical and chemical. We review model simulations from the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative to assess the changes in the tropospheric ozone burden and its budget from 1850 to 2010. Analysis of these data indicates that there has been significant growth in the ozone burden from 1850 to 2000 (approximately 43 + 9%) but smaller growth between 1960 and 2000 (approximately 16 + 10%) and that the models simulate burdens of ozone well within recent satellite estimates. The Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative model ozone budgets indicate that the net chemical production of ozone in the troposphere plateaued in the 1990s and has not changed since then inspite of increases in the burden. There has been a shift in net ozone production in the troposphere being greatest in the northern mid and high latitudes to the northern tropics, driven by the regional evolution of precursor emissions. An analysis of the evolution of tropospheric ozone through the 21st century, as simulated by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, reveals a large source of uncertainty associated with models themselves (i.e., in the way that they simulate the chemical and physical processes that control tropospheric ozone). This structural uncertainty is greatest in the near term (two to three decades), but emissions scenarios dominate uncertainty in the longer term (2050–2100) evolution of tropospheric ozone. This intrinsic model uncertainty prevents robust predictions of near-term changes in the tropospheric ozone burden, and we review how progress can be made to reduce this limitation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemistry Transport Models; Ozone; Ozone Budget; Tropospheric Chemistry; Tropospheric Ozone; Assessment Method; Atmospheric Chemistry; Cmip; Ozone; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Troposphere","assessment method; atmospheric chemistry; CMIP; ozone; spatiotemporal analysis; troposphere","","","Funding text 1: ATA and PTG would like to acknowledge support from National Centre for Atmospheric Science.

Differences in discharge characteristics including visual images, voltage-current waveforms, Lissajous figures, and temperature variation, were determined between the DDBD and SDBD reactors. Removal efficiency, mineralization rate, CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity, and energy yield were used to evaluate the toluene abatement performance of the two reactors. Compared to the SDBD reactor, the DDBD reactor exhibited more uniform and stable discharges due to a change in discharge mode. In addition, the DDBD reactor's dissipated power and reactor temperature (including the gas, barrier and ground electrode) were significantly lower than those in the SDBD reactor. At 22−24 kV, the DDBD reactor showed a higher toluene removal efficiency and mineralization rate, while at 14−16 kV, the SDBD reactor exhibited higher respective value. The energy efficiency of the DDBD was 2.5–3 times that of the SDBD reactor, and the overall energy constant k<inf>overall</inf> of the DDBD reactor (1.47 mL/J) was significantly higher than that of the SDBD reactor (0.367 mL/J) as revealed by the kinetics study.

The modification of ZSM-5 with Pd catalyst (2 wt %) substantially improved the adsorption capability for toluene. The catalyst adsorbing toluene was readily regenerated during the plasma-catalytic oxidation step. The synergistic effect of the catalyst promoted the toluene oxidation process as well as improved the selectivity towards CO<inf>2</inf>. As a method of reducing the energy in generating plasma, two cases (when the ground electrode was exposed to the external air and when the ground electrode was immersed in insulating oil) were compared.

All experiments were conducted at neutral and acidic pH to evaluate the effect of population change from bacteria to fungi on the BX biodegradation. The experiments demonstrated that acclimating wastewater inoculum at pH 4 increased the fungal to bacterial ratio. An increase of 11% for benzene and 22% for o-xylene was observed at pH 4 unamended-culture as compared to pH 7. Brij 35 was chosen as the optimum surfactant which was favorable for enhancing the bioavailability of BX at pH 4.

Exemplary applications of both non-thermal plasma and thermal plasma should underline the feasibility of scale-up to industrial application. A non-thermal plasma in modular form was built, which is designed for up to 1000 m³∙h−1 and was successfully practically tested in combination of non-thermal plasma (NTP), mineral adsorber and bio-scrubber for abatement of volatile organic components (VOCs), odorous substances and germs. Thermal plasmas are usually arc-heated plasmas, which are operated with different plasma gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, argon or air. In recent years steam plasmas were gradually established, adding liquid water as plasma gas. In the present system the plasma was directly operated with steam generated externally. Further progress of development of this system was described and critically evaluated towards performance data of an already commercially used water film-based system.

The prepared catalysts were characterized using different analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR/UV-vis) and N<inf>2</inf> adsorption/desorption. The effect of the preparation method has been evaluated in the photodegradation of ibuprofen (IBP) under visible light irradiation. The obtained results underlined the improvement of photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO<inf>2</inf> by metals under visible light. A mineralization of IBP up to 98 % was achieved after 4 h irradiation for the catalyst prepared by co-deposition precipitation with urea. Therefore, this catalyst could be suitable for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in aqueous media using solar light as the energy source. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Doping; Mesoporous Materials; Nanostructures; Photocatalysis; Supported Catalysts","","","","We, the authors, we are very thankful to the DGRST-MESRS in Algeria, the University of Tlemcen and ULCO for their financial support.","Añón, J.

In order to abate VOC emission, catalytic oxidation is widely applied in industries and is believed to be an efficient and economically feasible way for the elimination of VOCs. This review is primarily concentrated on summarizing the recent progress and developments in the catalytic oxidation of various VOCs over Pd-supported catalysts. Despite their high catalytic performances at much lower temperatures, the wide use of Pd-supported catalysts in the industry has been limited by their high cost, low thermal stability, and incomplete oxidation of VOCs. Hence, the intrinsic properties of the active sites and supports, the reaction conditions, the deactivation mechanism, and the strategy to reveal the catalytic oxidation pathway are also systematically summarized. This review aims to give a deep comprehension and guidance for the development of efficient and cost-effective Pd-supported catalysts in the near future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Oxidation; Deactivation Mechanism; Pd-supported Catalysts; Reaction Pathway; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Oxidation; Cost Effectiveness; Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Deactivation Mechanism; High Catalytic Performance; Intrinsic Property; Lower Temperatures; Pd-supported Catalysts; Photochemical Smog; Reaction Conditions; Secondary Organic Aerosols; Catalyst Supports","Catalytic oxidation; Cost effectiveness; Oxidation; Volatile organic compounds; Deactivation mechanism; High catalytic performance; Intrinsic property; Lower temperatures; Pd-supported catalysts; Photochemical smog; Reaction conditions; Secondary organic aerosols; Catalyst supports","","","Funding text 1: This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21707020) and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (2019A1515011469).; Funding text 2: PV would like to acknowledge The Royal Society-Newton International Fellowship for her postdoctoral research funding (NIF\R1\180185) at the University of Southampton.","Añón, J.

Four types of broadly studied metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (i.e., Cu- (MOF-199 (also known as HKUST-1)), Co- (Co-CUK-1), Zr- (UiO-66 (U6), and UiO-66-NH<inf>2</inf> (U6N)) were effectively synthesized, characterized, and studied as the adsorbents along with a microporous activated carbon (AC) as a reference. Further, a multiple target system that include eight VOCs (four aromatics (benzene, toluene, styrene, m-xylene) and four oxygen-containing aliphatic compounds (methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl isobutyl ketone (MiBK), butyl acetate (BuAc), and isobutyl alcohol (iBuAl))) was explored both as single and multi-component system. The MOFs adsorbed polar VOCs favorably, with the M199 outperforming the rest. The 10% breakthrough volume (L atm g−1) for M199 was noted to decrease in the following order: MiBK (7659) > MEK (4772) > iBuAl (1954) > styrene (1775) > m-xylene (316) > BuAc (206) > toluene (50) > benzene (36). In case of U6, the presence of amine groups (U6N) was seen to promote the adsorption of all eight VOCs. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT)-based modelling supported the enhanced adsorption performance of M199 over other MOFs in terms of rigid structure. The results further suggested apparent competition for the surface sorption sites between VOCs in a multicomponent system. In case of AC, the π-π interactions and van der Waals forces were the predominant -controls on the adsorption of VOCs. In contrast, the uncoordinated metal centers (Lewis acidic sites) were the key to the adsorption of polar VOCs by MOFs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption Mechanisms/interactions; Adsorption Of Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Pollution; Air Quality Management; Metal-organic Frameworks; Activated Carbon; Adsorption; Aliphatic Compounds; Benzene; Ketones; Metal-organic Frameworks; Mixtures; Organometallics; Styrene; Toluene; Van Der Waals Forces; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylene; Breakthrough Volumes; Enhanced Adsorptions; Metalorganic Frameworks (mofs); Methyl Ethyl Ketones; Methyl Isobutyl Ketone; Microporous Activated Carbons; Multi-component Systems; Predominant Control; Density Functional Theory","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Aliphatic compounds; Benzene; Ketones; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Mixtures; Organometallics; Styrene; Toluene; Van der Waals forces; Volatile organic compounds; Xylene; Breakthrough volumes; Enhanced adsorptions; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Methyl ethyl ketones; Methyl isobutyl ketone; Microporous activated carbons; Multi-component systems; Predominant control; Density functional theory","","","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge the support provided by the R&D Center for Green Patrol Technologies through the R&D for Global Top Environmental Technologies funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), as well as by a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (Grant No: 2016R1E1A1A01940995).; Funding text 2: We would like to acknowledge the support provided by the R&D Center for Green Patrol Technologies through the R&D for Global Top Environmental Technologies funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), as well as by a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (Grant No: 2016R1E1A1A01940995 ).","Añón, J.

However, there are challenges with regards to photocatalytic efficiency improvements, lab to industrial scaling up, and commercial product production. Several innovative approaches/strategies have been evolved towards TiO<inf>2</inf> modification with the focus of improving its photocatalytic efficiency. Taking these aspects into consideration, research has focused on the utilization of many of these advanced TiO<inf>2</inf> materials towards the development of construction materials such as concrete, mortar, pavements, paints, etc. This topical review focuses explicitly on capturing and highlighting research advancements in the last five years (mainly) (2014–2019) on the utilization of various modified TiO<inf>2</inf> materials for the development of practical photocatalytic building materials (PBM). We briefly summarize the prospective applications of TiO<inf>2</inf>-based building materials (cement, mortar, concretes, paints, coating, etc.) with relevance to the removal of outdoor/indoor NO<inf>x</inf> and volatile organic compounds, self-cleaning of the surfaces, etc. As a concluding remark, we outline the challenges and make recommendations for the future outlook of further investigations and developments in this prosperous area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Building Materials; Photocatalytic; Pollutant Removal; Self-cleaning; Titanium Dioxide","","","","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), grant funded by the Korean government (No. NRF-2018R1A2B2003832).","Lelieveld, Jos, The contribution of outdoor air pollution sources to premature mortality on a global scale, Nature, 525, 7569, pp. 367-371, (2015); Añón, J.

In this study, four typical metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MIL-101 (Cr), UiO-66, ZIF-8 and Cu-BDC were synthesized and applied to purify the indoor hexanal, and their adsorption capacities to hexanal were compared with the commercial activated carbon (AC). Our results show that the adsorption capacities of hexanal follow the order of MIL-101(Cr) (135 mg g−1)> UiO-66 (64.3 mg g−1)> ZIF-8 (40.3 mg g−1)> AC (35.8 mg g−1)> Cu-BDC (32.5 mg g−1), and the desorption capacities (by air) follow the order of MIL-101(Cr) (55.5 mg g−1)> UiO-66 (26.1 mg g−1)> AC (24.5 mg g−1)>ZIF-8 (19.3 mg g−1)> Cu-BDC (5.5 mg g−1), indicating that hexanal adsorbed on MIL-101 (Cr)/UiO-66 is more appropriate than the commercial AC to be desorbed. FTIR analysis confirms that O–H in Cr–OH/Zr–OH, O–C–O and aromatic C–H in H<inf>2</inf>BDC in both MIL-101 (Cr) and UiO-66 are possible sites for hexanal adsorption. DFT calculations further reveal that Cr–OH/Zr–OH and aromatic C–H in H<inf>2</inf>BDC are important sites to interact with C[dbnd]O in hexanal.

Different parameters effect on the concentration of O<inf>3</inf> and NO<inf>x</inf> during the degradation of toluene were studied. The exhaust in the process of toluene degradation was continuously detected and analyzed, and the degradation mechanism of toluene was explored. The results showed that the concentration of O<inf>3</inf> increased with the increase of the power density and discharge voltage of the plasma device. However, as the initial concentration of toluene increased, the concentration of O<inf>3</inf> basically keep steady. The concentration of NO<inf>x</inf> in the by-products increased with the discharge voltage, power density, and initial concentration of toluene in the plasma device, and the concentration of NO<inf>2</inf> was much higher than the concentration of NO. The degradation process of toluene was detected and analyzed. The results showed that the degradation mechanism of toluene by plasma includes high energy electron bombardment reaction, active radical reaction and ion molecule reaction. Among them, the effect of high-energy electrons on toluene degradation is the largest, followed by the effect of free radicals, in which oxygen radicals participated in the reaction mainly through the formation of C–O bond, C[dbnd]O bond, (CO)–O– bond and –OH radical, while nitrogen radicals participate in the reaction mainly through the formation of C–NH<inf>2</inf>, (C[dbnd]NH)- bond, C[tbnd]N bond and C–NO<inf>2</inf> bond.

In our recent laboratory-scale study, the use of UV-A (a less toxic ultraviolet light, a.k.a. “black light”) and a special TiO<inf>2</inf>-based photocatalyst reduced concentrations of several important air pollutants (NH<inf>3</inf>, CO<inf>2</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O, O<inf>3</inf>) without impact on H<inf>2</inf>S and CH<inf>4</inf>. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to (1) scale up the UV treatment to pilot scale, (2) evaluate the mitigation of odor and odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and (3) complete preliminary economic analyses. A pilot-scale experiment was conducted under commercial poultry barn conditions to evaluate photocatalyst coatings on surfaces subjected to UV light under field conditions. In this study, the reactor was constructed to support interchangeable wall panels and installed on a poultry farm. The effects of a photocatalyst's presence (photocatalysis and photolysis), UV intensity (LED and fluorescent), and treatment time were studied in the pilot-scale experiments inside a poultry barn. The results of the pilot-scale experiments were consistent with the laboratory-scale one: the percent reduction under photocatalysis was generally higher than photolysis. In addition, the percent reduction of target gases at a high light intensity and long treatment time was higher. The percent reduction of NH<inf>3</inf> was 5–9%. There was no impact on H<inf>2</inf>S, CH<inf>4</inf>, and CO<inf>2</inf> under any experimental conditions. N<inf>2</inf>O and O<inf>3</inf> concentrations were reduced at 6–12% and 87–100% by both photolysis and photocatalysis. In addition, concentrations of several VOCs responsible for livestock odor were reduced from 26 to 62% and increased with treatment time and light intensity. The odor was reduced by 18%. Photolysis treatment reduced concentrations of N<inf>2</inf>O, VOCs, and O<inf>3</inf>, only. The initial economic analysis has shown that LEDs are more efficient than fluorescent lights. Further scale-up and research at farm scale are warranted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Ammonia; Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations; Emissions; Indoor Air Quality; Odor; Photocatalysis; Poultry Production","","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by US Poultry & Egg Association Project #F080 Mitigation of Ammonia and Odor Emissions: Improving Indoor Air Quality in Poultry Housing with Black UV Light.

Experimental result indicates that the energy consumption is significantly reduced and heating effect can be effectively suppressed when the DBD plasma is ignited in pulse-modulated mode instead of continuous mode. The response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) model has been proposed to evaluate the contribution of key operating parameters including duty cycle and modulation frequency. The proposed model offers a good fit for actal data. The contribution of the modulation frequency is observed to be more dominant compared to the duty cycle for both the degradation efficiency and the energy yield. According to the results provided by the proposed model, the toluene degradation efficiency of 62.9 % and the energy yield of 0.90 g/kWh are obtained under the optimal conditions of 400 Hz modulation frequency and 56 % duty cycle. The effect of initial toluene concentration and gas flow rate have also been investigated. Increasing toluene initial concentration and gas flow rate are found to be unfavorable for the degradation of toluene, however, which are of benefit to the energy yield. A long-time experiment to assess the stability of pulse-modulated DBD has been successful performed. The possible pathways in plasma degradation of toluene is proposed based on the intermediates identification using GC–MS and FTIR. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Pulse-modulated; Response Surface Methodology; Vocs Degradation; Toluene; Biodegradation; Degradation; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Electric Discharges; Energy Utilization; Flow Control; Flow Of Gases; Surface Properties; Toluene; Central Composite Designs; Degradation Efficiency; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasmas; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Modulation Frequencies; Parameters Optimization; Pulse Modulated; Response Surface Methodology; Frequency Modulation; Toluene; Degradation; Experimental Study; Optimization; Parameter Estimation; Plasma; Response Surface Methodology; Volatile Organic Compound; Article; Concentration (parameter); Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Dielectric Constant; Energy Yield; Flow Rate; Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; Frequency Modulation; Gas Flow; Mass Fragmentography; Model; Molecular Stability; Process Optimization; Response Surface Method","Biodegradation; Degradation; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Energy utilization; Flow control; Flow of gases; Surface properties; Toluene; Central composite designs; Degradation efficiency; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Dielectric barrier discharges; Modulation frequencies; Parameters optimization; Pulse modulated; Response surface methodology; Frequency modulation; toluene; degradation; experimental study; optimization; parameter estimation; plasma; response surface methodology; volatile organic compound; Article; concentration (parameter); dielectric barrier discharge; dielectric constant; energy yield; flow rate; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; frequency modulation; gas flow; mass fragmentography; model; molecular stability; process optimization; response surface method","","toluene, 108-88-3","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 51877028, 51507026, and 51477025), State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment (EIPE18206), Dalian High-level Talents Innovation Support Plan (2018RQ28), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (DUT19JC20).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 51877028 , 51507026 , and 51477025 ), State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment ( EIPE18206 ), Dalian High-level Talents Innovation Support Plan ( 2018RQ28 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( DUT19JC20 ).","Añón, J.

From reactor design to the combination of different oxidative processes, many approaches have been exploited in order to reach higher photocatalytic reaction rates. When it comes to reactor design, enhancing photon transfer is still the biggest challenge to be overcome. Several types of photocatalytic reactors can provide a large surface-to-volume ratio, exhibiting satisfactory mass transfer; however, the irradiation of the entire catalytic coated surface has shown to be quite difficult for some particular reactor geometries. In this context, the use of miniaturized light sources e.g. LEDs has shown to be a promising alternative for a more “customized” irradiation profile, resulting in a more efficient catalytic surface illumination. Coupling PCO with other oxidative processes has been reported to enhance substantially the reaction rates. In fact, synergistic effects have been reported for both ozone and plasma-enhanced photocatalytic systems. The use of vacuum ultraviolet radiation (VUV, λ < 200 nm) in PCO processes is another commonly used strategy for the intensification of PCO processes. The improved photocatalytic activity for VUV-PCO process is usually related to the ability of VUV light to break most chemical bonds and generate strong oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals and ozone, through the photolysis of H<inf>2</inf>O and O<inf>2</inf>, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heterogeneous Photocatalysis; Non-thermal Plasma; Ozonation; Reactor Design; Vacuum Ultraviolet; Bond Strength (chemical); Irradiation; Light Sources; Mass Transfer; Ozone; Ozonization; Photolysis; Radiation Decontamination; Reaction Rates; Ternary Alloys; Heterogeneous Photocatalysis; Nonthermal Plasma; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Photocatalytic Reactions; Photocatalytic Reactors; Reactor Designs; Vacuum Ultraviolet Radiation; Vacuum Ultraviolets; Photocatalytic Activity","Bond strength (chemical); Irradiation; Light sources; Mass transfer; Ozone; Ozonization; Photolysis; Radiation decontamination; Reaction rates; Ternary alloys; Heterogeneous photocatalysis; Nonthermal plasma; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photocatalytic reactions; Photocatalytic reactors; Reactor designs; Vacuum ultraviolet radiation; Vacuum ultraviolets; Photocatalytic activity","","","This work was financially supported by Associate Laboratory LSRE-LCM – UID/EQU/50020/2019 – funded by national funds through FCT / MCTES (PIDDAC).

The production process in cork industries commonly includes a washing procedure based on water and temperature cycles in order to reduce off-flavors and decrease the amount of trichloroanisole (TCA) in cork samples. The treatment has been demonstrated to be effective for the designed purpose, but chemical changes in the volatile fraction of the cork sample are produced, which need to be further investigated through the chemometric examination of data obtained from the headspace. Ordinary principal component analysis (PCA) based on the numerical description provided by the chromatographic area of several target compounds was inconclusive. This led us to consider a new tool, which is presented here for the first time for an application in the chromatographic field. The superposing significant interaction rules (SSIR) method is a variable selector which directly analyses the raw internal data coming from the spectrophotometer software and, combined with PCA and discriminant analysis, has been able to separate a group of 56 cork samples into two groups: treated and non-treated. This procedure revealed the presence of two compounds, furfural and 5-methylfurfural, which are increased in the case of treated samples. These compounds explain the sweet notes found in the sensory evaluation of the treated corks.

Among the various strategies for VOC elimination, catalytic oxidation and recently photocatalytic oxidation are regarded as some of the most promising technologies for VOC total oxidation from urban and industrial waste streams. This work is focused on bimetallic supported catalysts, investigating systematically the progress and developments in the design of these materials. In particular, we highlight their advantages compared to those of their monometallic counterparts in terms of catalytic performance and physicochemical properties (catalytic stability and reusability). The formation of a synergistic effect between the two metals is the key feature of these particular catalysts. This review examines the state-of-the-art of a peculiar sector (the bimetallic systems) belonging to a wide area (i.e., the several catalysts used for VOC removal) with the aim to contribute to further increase the knowledge of the catalytic materials for VOC removal, stressing the promising potential applications of the bimetallic catalysts in the air purification. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Purification; Bimetallic Catalysts; Vocs","","","","Funding: R.F. thanks the PON project \u201CAIM\u201D founded by the European Social Found (ESF) CUP: E66C18001220005 for the financial support.","Yang, Cuiting, Abatement of various types of VOCs by adsorption/catalytic oxidation: A review, Chemical Engineering Journal, 370, pp. 1128-1153, (2019); He, Chi, Recent Advances in the Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds: A Review Based on Pollutant Sorts and Sources, Chemical Reviews, 119, 7, pp. 4471-4568, (2019); Amann, Markus Christian, The revision of the air quality legislation in the European Union related to ground-level ozone, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 78, 1-3, pp. 41-62, (2000); Dumanoğlu, Yetkin, Spatial and seasonal variation and source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a heavily industrialized region, Atmospheric Environment, 98, pp. 168-178, (2014); Añón, J.

Among air pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the main sources of air pollution. Many attempts have been made to control VOCs using catalysts, plasma, photolysis, and adsorption. Among them, oxidative catalysis by noble metals or transition metal oxides is considered one of the most feasible and effective methods to control VOCs. This paper reviews the experimental achievements on the abatement of VOCs using noble metals, transition metals and modified metal oxide catalysts. Although the catalytic degradation of VOCs appears to be feasible, there are unavoidable problems when only catalysis treatments are applied to the field. Therefore, catalysts including hybrid processes are developed to improve the removal efficiency of VOCs. This review addresses new hybrid treatments to remove VOCs using catalysts, including hybrid treatment combined with plasma, photolysis, and adsorption. The mechanism of the oxidation of VOCs by catalysts is explained by adsorption-desorption principles, such as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Eley-Rideal, and Mars-van-Krevelen mechanisms. A π-backbonding interaction between unsaturated compounds and transition metals is introduced to better understand the mechanism of VOC removals. Finally, several factors affecting the catalytic activities, such as support, component ratio, preparation method, metal loading, and deactivation factor, are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysis; Hybrid Treatment; Indoor Air Quality; Plasma; Vocs; Carbon Monoxide; Manganese Oxide; Oxygen; Adsorption; Air Quality; Catalysis; Catalyst Activity; Indoor Air Pollution; Photolysis; Plasmas; Precious Metals; Transition Metal Oxides; Unsaturated Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption Desorption; Back-bonding Interactions; Catalytic Degradation; Hybrid Treatment; Indoor Air Quality; Langmuir-hinshelwood; Mars-van Krevelen Mechanisms; Metal Oxide Catalysts; Plasma Applications; Carbon Monoxide; Manganese Oxide; Oxygen; Volatile Organic Compound; Adsorption; Air Quality; Catalysis; Indoor Air; Oxidation; Photolysis; Plasma; Air Pollution Control; Article; Catalyst; Degradation; Desorption; Priority Journal; Waste Component Removal","Adsorption; Air quality; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Indoor air pollution; Photolysis; Plasmas; Precious metals; Transition metal oxides; Unsaturated compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption desorption; Back-bonding interactions; Catalytic degradation; Hybrid treatment; Indoor air quality; Langmuir-Hinshelwood; Mars-van krevelen mechanisms; Metal oxide catalysts; Plasma applications; carbon monoxide; manganese oxide; oxygen; volatile organic compound; adsorption; air quality; catalysis; indoor air; oxidation; photolysis; plasma; air pollution control; Article; catalyst; degradation; desorption; priority journal; waste component removal","","carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; manganese oxide, 11129-60-5, 1317-35-7; oxygen, 7782-44-7","This research was supported by the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT ( 2017M1A2A2086839 ).","Aghbolaghy, Mostafa, Low Temperature Catalytic Oxidation of Binary Mixture of Toluene and Acetone in the Presence of Ozone, Catalysis Letters, 148, 11, pp. 3431-3444, (2018); Añón, J.

Doping TiO<inf>2</inf> with substance such as C, N, or metal can extend the threshold of the absorption spectrum to the visible spectrum region. Thus, doped-TiO<inf>2</inf> is able to decompose volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under an indoor environment. To date, most experimental works reported on photocatalytic kinetics were conducted inside small-scale devices. The performance of air purification function under the actual indoor application scenery need to be further clarified. For this purpose, it is crucial to predict the performance of autogenous air quality improvements by visible light-driven photocatalyst for the actual applications. This work has developed a model to evaluate the performance of functional coating with photocatalyst in removing VOCs. Factors such as the effects of coating designs and indoor ambient conditions on the air purification efficiency were studied.

Next, the status quo of DBD for VOCs removal was discussed in detail from four aspects: reactor structure (include electrode material and configuration, discharge gap and length, dielectric material and thickness, and number of dielectrics), power supplies (include applied voltage, frequency and pulsed power supply), packing materials (include packed position, properties of packing material, loaded catalyst on support and synergy of plasma and catalysis) and gas properties (include target reactants, gas flow rate, initial concentration, oxygen content and humidity level). The description of these factors is mainly based on their effects on discharge characteristics and VOCs decomposition in DBD. Subsequently, a number of aspects related to the practical implementation of DBD for VOCs treatment were described.

The effect of inlet TCE concentration in the range 0.12–2.34 g m−3 on TCE removal has studied for 55 days. During the continuous bioreactor operation, a maximum of 96% TCE removal was obtained for low inlet TCE concentration, whereas the highest elimination capacity was 151.2 g m−3 h−1 for the TCE loading rate of 175.0 g m−3 h−1. The carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) concentration profile from the airlift bioreactor revealed that the degraded TCE has primarily converted to CO<inf>2</inf> with a fraction of organic carbon utilized for bacterial growth. The artificial neural network (ANN) based model was able to successfully predict the performance of the bioreactor system using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) back propagation algorithm, and optimized biological topology is 3:12:1. The prediction accuracy of the model was high as the experimental data were in good agreement (R2 = 0.9923) with the ANN predicted data. Overall, from the bioreactor experiments and its ANN modeling, the potential strength of R. opacus in TCE biodegradation is proved. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airlift Bioreactor; Artificial Neural Network; Biodegradation; Carbon Dioxide; Rhodococcus Opacus; Trichloroethylene; Carbon Dioxide; Trichloroethylene; Carbon Dioxide; Trichloroethylene; Anesthetics; Backpropagation; Biodegradation; Bioinformatics; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Organic Carbon; Topology; Trichloroethylene; Air-lift Bioreactors; Concentration Profiles; Continuous Bioreactors; Continuous Operation; Elimination Capacity; Levenberg-marquardt; Prediction Accuracy; Rhodococcus Opacus; Neural Networks; Carbon Dioxide; Organic Carbon; Trichloroethylene; Artificial Neural Network; Back Propagation; Bacterium; Biodegradation; Bioreactor; Concentration (composition); Experimental Study; Gas Phase Reaction; Microbial Activity; Pollutant Removal; Article; Bacterial Growth; Biotechnological Production; Carbon Source; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Empty Bed Residence Time; Gas; Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm; Measurement Accuracy; Nonhuman; Oxygen Concentration; Reactor Operation; Waste Component Removal; Algorithm; Bioremediation; Isolation And Purification; Metabolism; Rhodococcus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Algorithms; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Neural Networks, Computer","Anesthetics; Backpropagation; Biodegradation; Bioinformatics; Bioreactors; Carbon dioxide; Organic carbon; Topology; Trichloroethylene; Air-lift bioreactors; Concentration profiles; Continuous bioreactors; Continuous operation; Elimination capacity; Levenberg-Marquardt; Prediction accuracy; Rhodococcus opacus; Neural networks; carbon dioxide; organic carbon; trichloroethylene; artificial neural network; back propagation; bacterium; biodegradation; bioreactor; concentration (composition); experimental study; gas phase reaction; microbial activity; pollutant removal; Article; bacterial growth; biotechnological production; carbon source; concentration (parameter); controlled study; empty bed residence time; gas; Levenberg Marquardt algorithm; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; oxygen concentration; reactor operation; waste component removal; algorithm; bioremediation; isolation and purification; metabolism; Rhodococcus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Algorithms; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Neural Networks, Computer","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; trichloroethylene, 79-01-6; Carbon Dioxide; Trichloroethylene","Funding text 1: The authors are highly grateful to the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Centre for the Environment and Central Instruments Facility, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Department of Chemical Engineering, Annamalai University, India, for all the support provided to carry out this research work.; Funding text 2: The authors are highly grateful to the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering , Centre for the Environment and Central Instruments Facility , Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati , Department of Chemical Engineering , Annamalai University, India, for all the support provided to carry out this research work.

Petroleum hydrocarbons compounds, for instance, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, are among the natural compounds of crude oil and petrol and are often found in surface and underground water as a result of industrial activities, especially the handling of petrochemicals, reservoir leakage or inappropriate waste disposal processes. Methods based on the conventional wastewater treatment processes are not able to effectively eliminate oil compounds, and the high concentrations of these pollutants, as well as active sludge, may affect the activities and normal efficiency of the refinery. The methods of removal should not involve the production of harmful secondary pollutants in addition to wastewater at the level allowed for discharge into the environment. The output of sewage filtration by coagulation and dissolved air flotation (DAF) flocculation can be transferred to a biological reactor for further purification. Advanced coagulation methods such as electrocoagulation and flocculation are more advanced than conventional physical and chemical methods, but the major disadvantages are the production of large quantities of dangerous sludge that is unrecoverable and often repelled. Physical separation methods can be used to isolate large quantities of petroleum compounds, and, in some cases, these compounds can be recycled with a number of processes. The great disadvantage of these methods is the high demand for energy and the high number of blockages and clogging of a number of tools and equipment used in this process. Third-party refinement can further meet the objective of water reuse using methods such as nano-filtration, reverse osmosis, and advanced oxidation. Adsorption is an emergency technology that can be applied using minerals and excellent materials using low-cost materials and adsorbents. By combining the adsorption process with one of the advanced methods, in addition to lower sludge production, the process cost can also be reduced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Advanced Oxidation; Coagulation; Oil Compounds; Removal Methods","","","","","Añón, J.

Emissions of ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>), hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf>S), greenhouse gases (GHGs), and odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a detrimental effect on the environment, climate, and quality of life in rural communities. We are building on previous research to bring advanced oxidation technologies from the lab to the farm. To date, we have shown that ultraviolet A (UV-A) has the potential to mitigate selected odorous gases and GHGs in the context of swine production. Much less research on emissions mitigation has been conducted in the context of poultry production. Thus, the study objective was to investigate whether the UV-A can mitigate NH<inf>3</inf>, H<inf>2</inf>S, GHGs, and O<inf>3</inf> in the simulated poultry barn environment. The effects of several variables were tested: the presence of photocatalyst, relative humidity, treatment time, and dust accumulation under two different light intensities (facilitated with fluorescent and light-emitting diode, LED, lamps). The results provide evidence that photocatalysis with TiO<inf>2</inf> coating and UV-A light can reduce gas concentrations of NH3, CO<inf>2</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O, and O<inf>3</inf>, without a significant effect on H<inf>2</inf>S and CH<inf>4</inf>. The particular % reduction depends on the presence of photocatalysts, relative humidity (RH), light type (intensity), treatment time, and dust accumulation on the photocatalyst surface. In the case of NH3, the reduction varied from 2.6-18.7% and was affected by RH and light intensity. The % reduction of NH<inf>3</inf> was the highest at 12% RH and increased with treatment time and light intensity. The % reduction of NH<inf>3</inf> decreased with the accumulation of poultry dust. The % reduction for H<inf>2</inf>S had no statistical difference under any experimental conditions. The proposed treatment of NH<inf>3</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>S was evaluated for a potential impact on important ambient air quality parameters, the possibility of simultaneously mitigating or generating GHGs. There was no statistically significant change in CH<inf>4</inf> concentrations under any experimental conditions. CO<inf>2</inf> was reduced at 3.8%-4.4%. N<inf>2</inf>O and O<inf>3</inf> concentrations were reduced by both direct photolysis and photocatalysis, with the latter having greater % reductions. As much as 6.9-12.2% of the statistically-significant mitigation of N<inf>2</inf>O was observed. The % reduction for O<inf>3</inf> ranged from 12.4-48.4%. The results warrant scaling up to a pilot-scale where the technology could be evaluated with economic analyses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Air Quality; Emissions; Led Uv; Livestock; Odor; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Poultry; Titanium Dioxide; Air Pollution; Air Quality; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Dust; Economic Analysis; Farm Buildings; Greenhouse Effect; Hydrogen Sulfide; Odors; Particulate Emissions; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Poultry; Quality Control; Sulfur Compounds; Sulfur Determination; Sustainable Development; Titanium Dioxide; Volatile Organic Compounds; Advanced Oxidation Technology; Ambient Air Quality; Direct Photolysis; Emissions Mitigation; Experimental Conditions; Livestock; Poultry Production; Statistical Differences; Greenhouse Gases; Agricultural Emission; Air Quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric Pollution; Catalysis; Greenhouse Gas; Hydrogen Sulfide; Odor; Ozone; Photochemistry; Pollutant Removal; Poultry; Titanium; Ultraviolet A Radiation; Suidae","Air pollution; Air quality; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Dust; Economic analysis; Farm buildings; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen sulfide; Odors; Particulate emissions; Photocatalysis; Photolysis; Poultry; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Sustainable development; Titanium dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Advanced oxidation technology; Ambient air quality; Direct photolysis; Emissions mitigation; Experimental conditions; Livestock; Poultry production; Statistical differences; Greenhouse gases; agricultural emission; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; catalysis; greenhouse gas; hydrogen sulfide; odor; ozone; photochemistry; pollutant removal; poultry; titanium; ultraviolet A radiation; Suidae","","","This research was supported by US Poultry & Egg Association Project #F080 ""Mitigation of Ammonia and Odor Emissions: Improving Indoor Air Quality in Poultry Housing with Black UV Light.

Within this built environment, human behavior and building design contribute to the accrual and dispersal of microorganisms; it is a collection of fomites that transfer microorganisms; reservoirs that collect biomass; structures that induce human or air movement patterns; and space types that encourage proximity or isolation between humans whose personal microbial clouds disperse cells into buildings. There have been recent calls to incorporate building microbiology into occupant health and exposure research and standards, yet the built environment is largely viewed as a repository for microorganisms which are to be eliminated, instead of a habitat which is inexorably linked to the microbial influences of building inhabitants. Health sectors have re-evaluated the role of microorganisms in health, incorporating microorganisms into prevention and treatment protocols, yet no paradigm shift has occurred with respect to microbiology of the built environment, despite calls to do so. Technological and logistical constraints often preclude our ability to link health outcomes to indoor microbiology, yet sufficient study exists to inform the theory and implementation of the next era of research and intervention in the built environment. This review presents built environment characteristics in relation to human health and disease, explores some of the current experimental strategies and interventions which explore health in the built environment, and discusses an emerging model for fostering indoor microbiology rather than fearing it. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomonitoring; Dermal Exposure; Disease; Environmental Monitoring; Epidemiology; Personal Exposure; Human; Indoor Air Pollution; Microflora; Air Pollution, Indoor; Built Environment; Humans; Microbiota","human; indoor air pollution; microflora; Air Pollution, Indoor; Built Environment; Humans; Microbiota","","","","Añón, J.

Research results for the structure-function relationship revealed that the physicochemical properties of WO<inf>3</inf>-Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> were notably promoted than single component metal oxide, due to the strong electron interaction between W, Nb and O elements, which were confirmed by the techniques of H<inf>2</inf>-TPR, positron lifetime spectra and XPS characterization.

The functionalized materials contributed to the improvement of adsorption, activation, cracking and deep oxidation of MCB on the catalyst surface, and only non-negligible production of CO byproduct was detected. Both the acid property and oxidative property played important roles in the catalytic degradation process, and their cooperative catalytic effect could be optimized by the catalyst composition and preparation process. 2W1Nb (W/Nb = 2:1, molar ratio) displayed the largest acid amount and the best redox property, and thus it displayed the highest catalytic degradation performance, and 50% conversion of MCB was achieved at 280 °C with the GHSV of 9000 mL g<inf>cat</inf> −1 h−1. Besides, in the 120 h continuous reaction, only slight decrease (from 91% to 86%) for the catalytic activity of 2W1Nb was observed in initial 7 h, showing that it was desired towards the demanding conditions (such as resistance to water adsorption, chlorine poison and carbon deposition). Moreover, the WO<inf>3</inf>-Nb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> materials also satisfied the environment-friendly and low-cost needs for environmental catalysis, which could be a promising alternative for traditional V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>-WO<inf>3</inf>/TiO<inf>2</inf> catalyst system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Combustion; Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbon; Cooperative Catalytic Effect; Solid Superacid; Wo3-nb2o5; Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Binary Alloys; Catalysis; Catalyst Activity; Combustion; Mineral Oils; Molar Ratio; Niobium; Niobium Oxide; Physicochemical Properties; Sol-gel Process; Sol-gels; Tungsten Compounds; Vanadium Pentoxide; Catalytic Combustion; Catalytic Effects; Chlorinated Aromatics; Solid Super Acid; Wo3-nb2o5; Catalytic Cracking","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Binary alloys; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Combustion; Mineral oils; Molar ratio; Niobium; Niobium oxide; Physicochemical properties; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Tungsten compounds; Vanadium pentoxide; Catalytic combustion; Catalytic effects; Chlorinated aromatics; Solid super acid; WO3-Nb2O5; Catalytic cracking","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports from the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (No. LQ19B030004 ), the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21906106 , 11975157 and 11575117 ), the Scientific Research Program of Shaoxing University (No. 2016LG1005 and 20165008 , controlled synthesis of Nb2O5 based mixed oxide materials for catalytic degradation of industrial organic pollutants), as well as the open-end fund from the Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Alternative Technologies for Fine Chemicals Process.","Añón, J.

This situation is forcing industrialists to reduce their emissions by either revising their processes, and/or by installing purification systems of their effluents. These are of a great variety, and each has their strengths and weaknesses. The trend is, therefore, to couple different processes to result in more effective treatments. Studies suggest that coupling photocatalysis and plasma in a reactor can provide better VOC removal efficiency while emitting fewer partially oxidized byproducts than that of these individual processes. However, there is a lack of information on the ability of this coupling to deal with varies types of pollutants. In addition, the flow rates treated will be 10-1000 times higher than in previous studies, which represents a clear difference in scale. The process will not be studied from a point of chemical view? Determination of the mechanisms and kinetics of the reactions involved - but from the point of view of process engineering. The objective is to make a review, firstly, the degradation of selected pollutants in plasma alone and in photocatalysis alone, then in a second time to compare these results to those of the coupling. These steps will also determine the influence of the conditions operating - pollutant charge, humidity.If conditions permit, the degradation of these mixed pollutants will then be addressed, the synergy effects and/or competition should not be neglected during treatment industrial effluents polluted by several compounds. Finally, a study will be devoted to the comparison of different configurations of reactors mixing plasma and photocatalysis at industrial scales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air; Non-thermal Plasma; Photocatalysis; Pilot And Industrial Application; Synergetic Effect","","","","","Fridman, A.

Other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx family) or volatile organic carbons (VOCs) that are exhausted from automobiles or factories in large cities are harmful for public health. From this aspect, the study on photocatalysts for the degradation of gaseous pollutants has been recommended. Photocatalysts are key intermediates in environmental applications since they undergo reactions in transforming pollutants to harmless products, benefitting from light energy. The photon energy produces free radicals of •O−2ads or H2O2 from semiconductors and molecular oxygen. These reactions generate other products such as holes which then produce OH•. These reactive species are initiators of photocatalytic reactions. For this purpose, a number of photocatalysts have been explored. These phenomena correspond to a wide variety of metal oxides or semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO, and WO3. The properties of photocatalysts can be elaborated using appropriate doping metals. The doping may reduce the bandgap and increase the photocatalyst activity by shifting the corresponding irradiation light to a visible area. Another suggestion to overcome the large bandgap of photocatalysts is to make mesoporous materials according to their high surface area. By reducing pore size to meso range (2–50nm) and increasing surface area, the photocatalytic characteristics could be greatly enhanced. Synthesis of porous photocatalysts with high surface area could be achieved by involving ionic liquids (ILs) as both environmentally benign media and structure-directing materials. ILs have the excellent solubility of inorganic reactants, and at the same time, they have low toxicity and are flameless. The composites of graphene oxide and photocatalysts have been recognized as efficient heterogeneous catalysts, due to their layered spaces that provide accessible catalytic active sites. This chapter first presents air pollutants and then introduces the most important photocatalysts for air purification. The modification of the photocatalyst even at the synthesis level or in the process is the final discussion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Purification; Bandgap; Heterogeneous Catalysts; Photocatalyst Activity; Photocatalytic Materials; Semiconductors","","","","","J Air Waste Manag Assoc, (1989); Añón, J.

Though most of the microorganisms are harmless to humans, they can cause diseases in humans as well as in animals and plants. Microorganisms play a vital role in food and dairy industries; production of enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, antibiotics, etc.; genetic engineering; biotechnology; and so on. With advancement in science and technology, the antisocial elements are manufacturing bioweapons by using the microorganisms and the toxins produced by them.

Interestingly, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. The aim of this paper was to investigate the simultaneous removal of hydrophobic hexane with hydrophilic ethanol, resulting in the enhanced removal of hexane in the presence of ethanol. Investigations were performed in a peat-perlite packed biotrickling filter and the process performance was monitored using both gas chromatography and electronic nose techniques. The results indicate that the length as well as the effciency of biofiltration during the start-up period depend on the feed composition, with higher effciency obtained when hexane and ethanol were fed together from the process initiation. The experiments in the steady-state period present the biofilter performance when different ratios of hydrophilic to hydrophobic compounds were fed to the biofilter. The obtained results show the synergistic effects of the addition of a hydrophilic compound on the removal effciency of hydrophobic hexane. The influence of the ratio of hydr ophilic to hydrophobic compounds is discussed in terms of enhancing the mass transfer phenomena for hydrophobic volatile organic compounds. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofiltration; Biotrickling Filtration; Electronic Nose; Ethanol; Hexane; Biofiltration; Detection Method; Electron; Ethanol; Experimental Study; Hydrophobicity; Noise; Performance Assessment; Pollutant Removal; Volatile Organic Compound","biofiltration; detection method; electron; ethanol; experimental study; hydrophobicity; noise; performance assessment; pollutant removal; volatile organic compound","","","","Proceedings of the Water Environment Federation, (2010); Añón, J.

Similarly, VOCs identified in these small businesses are included in the list of ozone precursors that harm the environment. We used a non-thermal plasma reactor with gas recycling to study the decomposition of dilute concentrations of VOCs in air. The non-thermal plasma reactor was a surface dielectric barrier discharge (surface DBD) type, and the target gases were methyl ethyl ketone, toluene and n-hexane at concentrations of 20, 50 and 100 ppmv. Highest decomposition efficiency (97%) was achieved by treating n-hexane at 20 ppmv. Gas recycling had an almost negligible effect during pollutant treatment at varying recycling rates (0-50%). Increasing the input energy resulted in higher decomposition efficiency, but had an inverse effect on the energy yield of the system. Concentrations of CO<inf>2</inf> and ozone increased linearly with the increase of energy input in the system. Consumption of ozone for other applications, such as water treatment or coupling the DBD system with an appropriate catalyst, may address this concern. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gas Recycling; Indoor Air Pollution; Mek; N-hexane; Non-thermal Plasma; Surface Dbd; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds","","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT (2017M1 A2A2086819).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT (2017M1 A2A2086819).","Añón, J.

As a crucial precursor of haze, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have become a major research focus. Methods: In this study, microwave-induced metal discharge was developed for VOC decomposition. Toluene was used as the VOC model compound. Four types of metal strips were investigated for their decomposition efficiency of toluene using a microwave-induced metal discharge process. Results: All discharges, regardless of the metal type, achieved a high decomposition efficiency of toluene [> 60% (mol/mol)]. In addition, the effects of reaction conditions such as metal strip weight, gas flow rate, microwave power, and gas initial concentration were studied to investigate the decomposition efficiency. The reaction conditions were optimized following a multi-factor orthogonal experiment. The weight of the metal strips and gas flow rate had greater impacts on the decomposition efficiency, whereas the microwave power had a moderate impact. The major reaction products were CO<inf>2</inf>, CO, O<inf>3</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O. Both hydroxyl radicals and active oxygen atoms were very important for toluene oxidation. Conclusion: This study offers an important reference for the development of new technology to support the decomposition of VOCs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition Efficiency; Metal Discharge; Microwave; Toluene; Voc; Efficiency; Electric Discharges; Flow Of Gases; Ionization Of Gases; Metals; Microwave Generation; Microwaves; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Decomposition Efficiency; Discharge Process; Environmental Issues; Hydroxyl Radicals; Initial Concentration; Orthogonal Experiment; Reaction Conditions; Toluene Oxidation; Strip Metal","Efficiency; Electric discharges; Flow of gases; Ionization of gases; Metals; Microwave generation; Microwaves; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Decomposition efficiency; Discharge process; Environmental issues; Hydroxyl radicals; Initial concentration; Orthogonal experiment; Reaction conditions; Toluene oxidation; Strip metal","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements The authors thank the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 51506116 and 51376112), and the Shandong Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (JQ201514).; Funding text 2: The authors thank the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 51506116 and 51376112), and the Shandong Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (JQ201514).","Añón, J.

Although several specific analytical methods are currently used, the simultaneous analysis of these compounds in a complex matrix remains a challenge. The combination of positive and negative ionization selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) allows the accurate, sensitive and high-frequency analysis of complex gas mixtures of these compounds. Methods: The ion–molecule reactions of negative precursor ions (OH−, O•−, O<inf>2</inf> •−, NO<inf>2</inf> − and NO<inf>3</inf> −) with five aldehydes and four carboxylic acids were investigated in order to provide product ions and rate constants for the quantification of these compounds by negative ion SIFT-MS. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional analysis methods and/or with already implemented SIFT-MS positive ionization methods. The modelling of hydroxide ion (OH−)/molecule reaction paths by ab-initio calculation allowed a better understanding of these gas-phase reactions. Results: Deprotonation systematically occurs by reaction between negative ions and aldehydes or acids, leading to the formation of [M − H]− primary ions. Ab-initio calculations demonstrated the α-CH deprotonation of aldehydes and the acidic proton abstraction for fatty acids. For aldehydes, the presence of water in the flow tube leads to the formation of hydrated ions, [M − H]−.H<inf>2</inf>O. With the NO<inf>2</inf> − precursor ion, a second reaction channel results in ion–molecule association with the formation of M.NO<inf>2</inf> − ions. Conclusions: Except for formaldehyde, all the studied compounds can be quantified by negative ion SIFT-MS with significant rate constants. In addition to positive ion SIFT-MS with H<inf>3</inf>O+, O<inf>2</inf> + and NO+ precursor ions, negative ionization with O•−, O<inf>2</inf> •−, OH−, NO<inf>2</inf> − and NO<inf>3</inf> − extends the range of analysis of aldehydes and carboxylic acids in air without a preparation or separation step. This methodology was illustrated by the simultaneous quantification in single-scan experiments of seven aldehydes and six carboxylic acids released by building materials. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aldehydes; Association Reactions; Dimers; Dissociation; Food Products; Gases; Ionization Of Gases; Molecules; Negative Ions; Phase Interfaces; Positive Ions; Rate Constants; Volatile Organic Compounds; Ab Initio Calculations; Analytical Method; Direct Analysis; Gas-phases; Indoor Air; Ion Molecule/reaction; Organoleptic Properties; Precursor Ions; Selected Ion Flow Tubes; Simultaneous Analysis; Mass Spectrometry","Aldehydes; Association reactions; Dimers; Dissociation; Food products; Gases; Ionization of gases; Molecules; Negative ions; Phase interfaces; Positive ions; Rate constants; Volatile organic compounds; Ab initio calculations; Analytical method; Direct analysis; Gas-phases; Indoor air; Ion molecule/reaction; Organoleptic properties; Precursor ions; Selected ion flow tubes; Simultaneous analysis; Mass spectrometry","","","","Añón, J.

A double dielectric barrier discharge (DDBD) reactor was filled with two common adsorbents, γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and ZSM-5, in various combinations. Packing material, high-voltage electrode structure, and gas-flow mode were investigated to optimize this reactor. The reactor packed with a mixture of γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and ZSM-5 provided a mineralization rate 6.1% to –14.1% greater than one using a single material. Specifically, the highest mineralization rate was obtained in a DDBD reactor packed with γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> in the inner tube and ZSM-5 in the outer tube. Using the optimal combination of packing material, two high-voltage electrodes were compared. A higher mineralization rate was observed in the reactor with a rod electrode (63.3%) than in one equipped with a coil electrode (53.7%), The total amounts of O<inf>3</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O generated were much less in the reactor with a rod electrode. The effect of gas-flow mode on toluene decomposition was investigated and the result showed that mode 1 (with the gas flowing from the inner tube into the outer tube during both adsorption and discharge phases) could not only improve the degradation of toluene, but could also suppress the generation of O<inf>3</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O. A possible mechanism for toluene decomposition in the packed-bed DDBD reactor was proposed based on the analysis of organic intermediates remaining in the adsorbents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition Mechanism; Double Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Non-thermal Plasma; Toluene Removal; Alumina; Aluminum Oxide; Decomposition; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Electrodes; Flow Control; Flow Of Gases; Hybrid Systems; Insulated Wire; Mineralogy; Packed Beds; Toluene; Configuration And Optimizations; Decomposition Mechanism; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Reactors; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; High Voltage Electrodes; Nonthermal Plasma; Organic Intermediates; Toluene Decomposition; Electric Discharges","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Decomposition; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electrodes; Flow control; Flow of gases; Hybrid systems; Insulated wire; Mineralogy; Packed beds; Toluene; Configuration and optimizations; Decomposition mechanism; Dielectric barrier discharge reactors; Dielectric barrier discharges; High voltage electrodes; Nonthermal plasma; Organic intermediates; Toluene decomposition; Electric discharges","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFC0212204), Shaanxi Key R&D Program (No. 2018ZDCXL-SF-02-04), General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018 M643595), Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (No. 2019JQ-177) and International Science and Technology Cooperation Program in Shaanxi Province (No. 2018KW-011).; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFC0212204 ), Shaanxi Key R&D Program (No. 2018ZDCXL-SF-02-04 ), General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018 M643595 ), Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (No. 2019JQ-177 ) and International Science and Technology Cooperation Program in Shaanxi Province (No. 2018KW-011 ).","Añón, J.

However, the performance of PCO is hindered at high humidity conditions, due to the superhydrophilic surface of TiO<inf>2</inf> and competition between VOCs and water molecules for adsorption on surface's active sites. Herein, the photocatalytic activities of P25 and surface fluorinated P25 (F-P25) coated on nickel foam were evaluated for degradation of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). Surface fluorination enhanced the UV light absorption and reduced the charge carrier recombination. Therefore, the photocatalytic efficiency and by-product generation rate of F-P25 are investigated in a continuous reactor operating at different inlet contaminant concentrations (200-1000â»ppb), relative humidity levels (0-80%), light intensities (37 and 28â»W/m2) and residence time (0.013-0.076â»s). Results indicated that the surface fluorination of P25 enhanced the PCO efficiency of MEK removal in all tested conditions, compared to P25. The MEK removal efficiency under UV irradiation for three-layer and one-layer of F-P25 photocatalyst are 92% and 73%, respectively. Accordingly, by-products generation was considerably decreased using three layers of F-P25 photocatalyst. Moreover, the reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic oxidation of MEK is also proposed. The results of this research will ultimately lead to enhancing the efficiency of PCO process, especially in high humid condition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","By-product; P25-tio2; Photocatalytic Oxidation (pco); Surface Fluorination; Volatile Organic Compound (voc); Byproducts; Efficiency; Fluorination; Halogenation; Indoor Air Pollution; Irradiation; Ketones; Light Absorption; Molecules; Oxidation; Titanium Dioxide; Volatile Organic Compounds; Charge Carrier Recombination; Contaminant Concentrations; P25-tio2; Photocatalytic Efficiency; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Superhydrophilic Surface; Surface Fluorination; Volatile Organic Compound (voc); Photocatalytic Activity","Byproducts; Efficiency; Fluorination; Halogenation; Indoor air pollution; Irradiation; Ketones; Light absorption; Molecules; Oxidation; Titanium dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Charge carrier recombination; Contaminant concentrations; P25-TiO2; Photocatalytic efficiency; Photocatalytic oxidations; Superhydrophilic surface; Surface fluorination; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Photocatalytic activity","","","","Añón, J.

In this study, gas-liquid photocatalytic oxidation (LPCO) was exploited to improve the catalytic activity and stability by continuously bubbling VOCs into water. Toluene and commercial TiO<inf>2</inf> (P25) were chosen as the representative VOC pollutant and photocatalyst, respectively. Toluene removal efficiency in LPCO was about 6 times of that in conventional SPCO, and no intermediates were detected in the exhaust of LPCO probably due to its high degradation and mineralization rates. However, plentiful intermediates were identified by GC-MS and ITMS both in the gas outlet and on the surface of catalyst in SPCO, which may lead to photocatalytic deactivation. Moreover, LPCO exhibited superior catalytic activity towards typical soluble VOCs such as formaldehyde compared to SPCO. The soluble intermediates formed from toluene degradation can be easily removed by sustaining UV irradiation to avoid water pollution and the water after purification can be reused in LPCO. This study provides a novel gas-liquid photocatalytic oxidation to replace conventional gas-solid photocatalytic oxidation for the sake of better catalytic activity and fewer by-products. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gas-liquid Phase; Gaseous Toluene; Photocatalytic Oxidation; Vocs; Formaldehyde; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Water; Titanium; Air Pollutants; Formaldehyde; Gases; Titanium; Toluene; Water; Biodegradation; Bubble Formation; Catalyst Activity; Gases; Irradiation; Liquids; Oxidation; Photocatalytic Activity; Photodegradation; Reaction Intermediates; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollution; Water Treatment; Catalytic Deactivation; Gas Liquids; Gaseous Toluene; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Toluene Degradations; Toluene Removal Efficiency; Uv Irradiation; Catalytic Oxidation; Formaldehyde; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Water; Titanium; Catalysis; Irradiation; Mineralization; Photooxidation; Ultraviolet Radiation; Volatile Organic Compound; Water Pollution; Adsorption; Article; Gas; Intermethod Comparison; Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry; Liquid; Mass Fragmentography; Molecular Stability; Photocatalysis; Photodegradation; Recycling; Solid; Surface Property; Ultraviolet Irradiation; Water Management; Water Pollutant; Water Pollution Control; Air Pollutant; Chemical Model; Chemistry; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Formaldehyde; Models, Chemical; Oxidation-reduction; Titanium; Ultraviolet Rays; Water","Biodegradation; Bubble formation; Catalyst activity; Gases; Irradiation; Liquids; Oxidation; Photocatalytic activity; Photodegradation; Reaction intermediates; Titanium dioxide; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Water pollution; Water treatment; Catalytic deactivation; Gas liquids; Gaseous toluene; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic oxidations; Toluene degradations; Toluene removal efficiency; UV irradiation; Catalytic oxidation; formaldehyde; titanium dioxide; toluene; water; titanium; catalysis; irradiation; mineralization; photooxidation; ultraviolet radiation; volatile organic compound; water pollution; adsorption; Article; gas; intermethod comparison; ion trap mass spectrometry; liquid; mass fragmentography; molecular stability; photocatalysis; photodegradation; recycling; solid; surface property; ultraviolet irradiation; water management; water pollutant; water pollution control; air pollutant; chemical model; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Formaldehyde; Models, Chemical; Oxidation-Reduction; Titanium; Ultraviolet Rays; Water","","formaldehyde, 50-00-0; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; toluene, 108-88-3; water, 7732-18-5; titanium, 7440-32-6; Air Pollutants; Formaldehyde; Gases; Titanium; Toluene; Water","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No. 21677179 ), Guangdong Special Fund for Science & Technology Development ( Innovation Platform Construction of Guangdong and Hong Kong , No. 2017B050504001 , and Guangdong Applied Science and Technology Research & Development Fund , No. 2015B020236004 ), NSFC and Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme (No. 51561165015 and No. N_HKU718/15 ), Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project (No. 201504301654288 ) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0204800 ).","Añón, J.

Odorous emissions are affected by the operation of stabilization processes via methods such as anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, alkaline treatment, thermal drying, or composting. Commonly used sampling and measurement methods for assessing odor emissions were identified and key odorants reported for biosolids produced using different stabilization methods. Generally, dominant odorants from biosolids were volatile sulfur compounds; however other odorants such as trimethylamine, ammonia, indole, p-cresol and pinene may also be sensorially important in different types of stabilized biosolids. Therefore, initial studies should target a range of odorants potentially emitted at different sites. The use of sensory analysis, which was limited in many studies, coupled with analytical methods can be effectively used to characterize nuisance emissions. The processing of the biosolids both before and after stabilization was shown in many studies to affect the resultant biosolids odorous emissions. These findings suggest that not only should the operational performance of biosolids processing before, during and after stabilization should be reported but that the biosolids management systems should consider the whole biosolids processing train, rather than just the operation of the chosen stabilization method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerobic Digestion; Alkaline Stabilization; Anaerobic Digestion; Composting; Nuisance Impacts; Olfactory; Sludge; Stabilization; Thermal Drying; Wastewater Treatment; Indole; Para Cresol; Pinene; Trimethylamine; Ammonia; Biological Materials; Biosolids; Composting; Drying; Odor Control; Sensory Analysis; Sludge Digestion; Stabilization; Sulfur Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Aerobic Digestions; Nuisance Impacts; Olfactory; Sludge; Thermal Drying; Anaerobic Digestion; Bulking Agent; Fragrance; Indole; Para Cresol; Pinene; Sulfur Derivative; Trimethylamine; Volatile Organic Compound; Activated Sludge; Alkalinity; Anaerobic Digestion; Biosolid; Composting; Emission; Literature Review; Odor; Olfactory Cue; Stabilization; Wastewater Treatment; Aeration; Article; Carbon Footprint; Carbon Sequestration; Degradation Kinetics; Dewatering; Hydrolysis; Microbial Growth; Municipal Wastewater; Ph; Practice Guideline; Sensory Analysis; Soil Moisture; Solids Retention Time; Temperature; Waste Water Management; Water Retention","Ammonia; Biological materials; Biosolids; Composting; Drying; Odor control; Sensory analysis; Sludge digestion; Stabilization; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Aerobic digestions; nuisance impacts; olfactory; sludge; Thermal drying; Anaerobic digestion; bulking agent; fragrance; indole; para cresol; pinene; sulfur derivative; trimethylamine; volatile organic compound; activated sludge; alkalinity; anaerobic digestion; biosolid; composting; emission; literature review; odor; olfactory cue; stabilization; wastewater treatment; aeration; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; degradation kinetics; dewatering; hydrolysis; microbial growth; municipal wastewater; pH; practice guideline; sensory analysis; soil moisture; solids retention time; temperature; waste water management; water retention","","indole, 120-72-9; para cresol, 106-44-5; pinene, 80-56-8; trimethylamine, 75-50-3","This research was funded by the CRC for Low Carbon Living Ltd [project RP2008] (supported by the Cooperative Research Centres program, an Australian Government initiative) with industry partners (Sydney Water, SA Water, Hunter Water and Suez Environmental).

This technique has been studied in laboratory for more than twenty years and experimental data is abundant. However, mostly qualitative information has been obtained from that data and no model has been developed for predicting the treatment performance from a given set of parameters. In this paper, we establish such a model, based on experimental data extracted from 69 scientific publications. This model, obtained through a linear regression, uses both quantitative and qualitative variables to predict the energy yield of the treatment. In 80% of the data points, the measured energy yield lies between 0.6 and 1.75 times the predicted value. We also used the model to evaluate quantitatively the impact of several parameters of the treatment, such as the initial concentration, the presence of a catalyst or the reactor type. Being so, the model presented here is an invaluable tool for both scientists and engineers interested in the treatment of VOC by non-thermal plasma. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linear Regression; Non-thermal Plasma; Volatile Organic Compounds; Linear Regression; Plasma Applications; Volatile Organic Compounds; Experimental Data Analysis; Initial Concentration; Non-thermal Plasma Treatment; Nonthermal Plasma; Qualitative Information; Scientific Publications; Scientists And Engineers; Treatment Performance; River Pollution","Linear regression; Plasma applications; Volatile organic compounds; Experimental data analysis; Initial concentration; Non-thermal plasma treatment; Nonthermal plasma; Qualitative information; Scientific publications; Scientists and engineers; Treatment performance; River pollution","","","","Preis, Sergei V., Potential of electric discharge plasma methods in abatement of volatile organic compounds originating from the food industry, Journal of Environmental Management, 114, pp. 125-138, (2013); Añón, J.

Numerous studies have been carried out to improve the effectiveness and performance of this technology. In addition, the development of appropriate models can enhance the understanding of reactor performance and the evaluation the intrinsic kinetic parameters that enable the scale up or re-design of more efficient large-scale photocatalytic reactors. This paper reviews recent research works on mathematical modeling of gas phase photocatalytic reactors and analyses different key factors that can enhance pollutants decomposition performance. First, the fundamental of the photocatalytic oxidation process and degradation reaction mechanism are briefly described. Then, to study kinetics of reaction, this paper focuses on Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation, which is by far the most common kinetic model that takes both adsorption and reaction processes into account. Moreover, an overall mass balance that contains advection, diffusion, and reaction rate terms, is analyzed to obtain a comprehensive mathematical model. In the end, the influence of key operating parameters (e.g. flow rate, catalyst surface area and porosity, and catalyst thickness) on the photocatalytic process and removal efficiency of the reactor are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mass Balance; Mathematical Modeling; Photocatalytic Oxidation; Reaction Kinetics; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalysts; Fog; Kinetic Parameters; Mathematical Models; Oxidation; Reaction Kinetics; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption And Reactions; Decomposition Performance; Intrinsic Kinetic Parameters; Langmuir Hinshelwood Equation; Mass Balance; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Photocatalytic Process; Photocatalytic Reactors; Indoor Air Pollution; Degradation; Indoor Air; Mass Balance; Numerical Model; Oxidation; Reaction Kinetics; Volatile Organic Compound","Catalysts; Fog; Kinetic parameters; Mathematical models; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption and reactions; Decomposition performance; Intrinsic kinetic parameters; Langmuir Hinshelwood equation; Mass balance; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photocatalytic process; Photocatalytic reactors; Indoor air pollution; degradation; indoor air; mass balance; numerical model; oxidation; reaction kinetics; volatile organic compound","","","The authors would like to express their gratitude to Concordia University for the support through the Concordia Research Chair – Energy & Environment.","Añón, J.

Where ventilation systems facilitate disease transmission to humans or animals, there exists a need for control measures that provide effective protection while imposing minimal pressure differential. In the present study, viral aerosols in an airstream were subjected to non-thermal plasma (NTP) exposure within a packed-bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor. Comparisons of plaque assays before and after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing inactivation of aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied voltage. At 30 kV and an air flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of infective virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction represented ∼2 log of the MS2 inactivated and ∼0.35 log physically removed in the packed bed. Increasing the air flow rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not significantly impact virus inactivation effectiveness. Activated carbon-based ozone filters greatly reduced residual ozone, in some cases down to background levels, while adding less than 20 Pa pressure differential to the 45 Pa differential pressure across the packed bed at the flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacteriophage Ms2; Bioaerosol Inactivation; Non-thermal Plasma; Ozone; Plaque Assay; Qpcr; Activated Carbon; Aerosols; Air; Dielectric Materials; Disease Control; Diseases; Electric Discharges; Ozone; Plasma Applications; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Superconducting Materials; Ventilation; Viruses; Bacteriophage Ms2; Bioaerosols; Nonthermal Plasma; Plaque Assay; Qpcr; Packed Beds","Activated carbon; Aerosols; Air; Dielectric materials; Disease control; Diseases; Electric discharges; Ozone; Plasma applications; Polymerase chain reaction; Superconducting materials; Ventilation; Viruses; Bacteriophage MS2; Bioaerosols; Nonthermal plasma; Plaque assay; qPCR; Packed beds","","","","Añón, J.

The emission of these pollutants has led to a large decline in air quality in numerous regions around the world, which has ultimately led to concerns regarding their impact on human health and general well-being. Catalytic oxidation is regarded as one of the most promising strategies for VOC removal from industrial waste streams. This Review systematically documents the progresses and developments made in the understanding and design of heterogeneous catalysts for VOC oxidation over the past two decades. It addresses in detail how catalytic performance is often drastically affected by the pollutant sources and reaction conditions. It also highlights the primary routes for catalyst deactivation and discusses protocols for their subsequent reactivation. Kinetic models and proposed oxidation mechanisms for representative VOCs are also provided. Typical catalytic reactors and oxidizers for industrial VOC destruction are further discussed. We believe that this Review will provide a great foundation and reference point for future design and development in this field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Quality; Catalyst Deactivation; Organic Pollutants; Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Performance; Heterogeneous Catalyst; Industrial Waste Streams; Oxidation Mechanisms; Peroxyacetyl Nitrates; Reaction Conditions; Secondary Organic Aerosols; Tropospheric Ozone; Catalytic Oxidation","Air quality; Catalyst deactivation; Organic pollutants; Oxidation; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic performance; Heterogeneous catalyst; Industrial waste streams; Oxidation mechanisms; Peroxyacetyl nitrates; Reaction conditions; Secondary organic aerosols; Tropospheric ozone; Catalytic oxidation","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21677114, 21876139), and the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0204200).

Non-thermal plasma (NTP) technologies are newly developed methods and became a research trend in recent years regarding the removal of VOCs from the air stream. Due to its unique characteristics, such as rapid response at room temperature, bulk homogenized volume, high reaction efficiency, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technology is considered one of the most promising techniques of NTP. This paper reviews recent progress of DBD plasma technology for abatement of VOCs. The principle of plasma generation in DBD and its configurations (electrode, discharge gap, dielectric barrier material, etc.) are discussed in details. Based on previously published literature, attention has been paid on the effect of DBD configuration on the removal of VOCs. Effect of various process parameters such as initial concentration, gas feeding rate, oxygen content and input power on VOCs removal are also considered. Moreover, the role of catalysis and inhibitors in VOCs removal by DBD system are presented. Finally, a modified configuration of the DBD reactor, i.e. double dielectric barrier discharge (DDBD) for the abatement of VOCs is discussed. It was suggested that the DDBD plasma reactor could be used for higher conversion efficiency as well as for avoiding solid residue deposition on the electrode. These depositions can interfere with the performance of the reactor.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abatement; Dielectric Barrier Discharge (dbd); Input Power; Non-thermal Plasma (ntp); Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Deposition; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Dust Abatement; Efficiency; Electric Discharges; Electrodes; Flow Control; Gas Chromatography; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Treatment; Dielectric Barrier; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasmas; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Initial Concentration; Input Power; Nonthermal Plasma; Process Parameters; Reaction Efficiency; Plasma Applications","Deposition; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Dust abatement; Efficiency; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Flow control; Gas chromatography; Volatile organic compounds; Waste treatment; Dielectric barrier; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Dielectric barrier discharges; Initial concentration; Input power; Nonthermal plasma; Process parameters; Reaction efficiency; Plasma applications","","","Acknowledgements This work was financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFD1100605).","Añón, J.

Thermal desorption is one of the methods commonly used to remediate contaminated soil. This method has received increasing attention for remediating contaminated sites due to its advantages, such as suitability to different types of contaminants, short treatment period, high efficiency, high safety, and capability to recycle soil and contaminants. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on thermal desorption. Introduction of the mechanism, classification, and cost of thermal desorption is presented. Factors affecting the performance of thermal desorption (heating temperature, heating time, heating rate, carrier gas, soil particle size, moisture content, initial concentration of contaminants, and additives) are reviewed. Thermal desorption produces off-gases, which are mostly organic compounds and may result in secondary pollution. Thus far, treatment methods for off-gas have not been systematically investigated. This paper also summarizes current methods for treatment of off-gas in the soil field and of volatile organic compounds in atmospheric and water pollution fields. Several feasible off-gas treatment methods are also comparatively analyzed, and the corresponding principles, advantages, disadvantages, and application ranges are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Off-gas Treatment; Remediation Of Contaminated Soil; Semi-volatile Contaminants; Soil Pollution; Thermal Desorption; Volatile Contaminants; Soil Pollutants; Additives; Contamination; Gases; Particle Size; Remediation; Soils; Thermal Desorption; Thermal Pollution; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Pollution; Contaminated Sites; Contaminated Soils; Environmental Concerns; Heating Temperatures; Initial Concentration; Off-gas Treatment; Secondary Pollution; Volatile Contaminants; Soil Pollution; Organic Compound; Volatile Organic Compound; Desorption; Literature Review; Soil Pollution; Soil Remediation; Waste Treatment; Bioremediation; Concentration (parameter); Gas; Heating; Moisture; Particle Size; Recycling; Review; Thermal Desorption; Water Pollution; Ecosystem Restoration; Isolation And Purification; Pollution; Prevention And Control; Procedures; Soil Pollutant; Temperature; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration And Remediation; Heating; Soil Pollutants; Temperature","Additives; Contamination; Gases; Particle size; Remediation; Soils; Thermal desorption; Thermal pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Water pollution; Contaminated sites; Contaminated soils; Environmental concerns; Heating temperatures; Initial concentration; Off-gas treatment; Secondary pollution; Volatile contaminants; Soil pollution; organic compound; volatile organic compound; desorption; literature review; soil pollution; soil remediation; waste treatment; bioremediation; concentration (parameter); gas; heating; moisture; particle size; recycling; Review; thermal desorption; water pollution; ecosystem restoration; isolation and purification; pollution; prevention and control; procedures; soil pollutant; temperature; Environmental Pollution; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Heating; Soil Pollutants; Temperature","","Soil Pollutants","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51876104 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province , China ( ZR2018MEE033 ), and the Key R&D Program of Shandong Province, China ( 2018GGX104010 ).

To tackle this issue, various physical and chemical techniques are applied to eliminate VOC emissions so as to reduce atmospheric pollution. Among these methods, non-thermal plasma (NTP) is receiving increasing attention for the higher removal efficiency, non-selectivity, and moderate operation, whereas the unwanted producing of NO<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> remains important drawback. In this study, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor with wedged high voltage electrode coupled CuO foam in an in plasma catalytic (IPC) system was developed to remove toluene as the target VOC. The monolith CuO foam exhibits advantages of easy installation and controllable of IPC length. The influencing factors of IPC reaction were studied. Results showed stronger and more stable plasma discharge in the presence of CuO foam in DBD reactor. Enhanced performance was observed in IPC reaction for both of toluene conversion rate and CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity compared to the sole NTP process at the same input energy. The longer the contributed IPC length, the higher the toluene removal efficiency. The toluene degradation mechanism under IPC condition was speculated. The producing of NO<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> under IPC process were effectively removed using Na<inf>2</inf> SO<inf>3</inf> bubble absorption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cuo Foam; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; In Plasma Catalytic; Toluene; Vocs; Carbon Dioxide; Copper Oxide; Toluene; Copper; Cupric Oxide; Air Pollutants; Copper; Cupric Oxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Carbon Dioxide; Copper Oxide; Toluene; Copper; Cupric Oxide; Volatile Organic Compound; Byproduct; Catalysis; Catalyst; Electrode; Foam; Oxidation; Plasma; Alternating Current; Article; Chemical Reaction; Concentration (parameter); Controlled Study; Degradation Kinetics; Gas Permeability; Humidity; Molecular Interaction; Molecular Stability; Plasma Catalytic Oxidation; Quality Control; X Ray Diffraction; Air Pollutant; Chemistry; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Copper; Electrodes; Oxidation-reduction; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds","carbon dioxide; copper oxide; toluene; copper; cupric oxide; volatile organic compound; byproduct; catalysis; catalyst; electrode; foam; oxidation; plasma; alternating current; Article; chemical reaction; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation kinetics; gas permeability; humidity; molecular interaction; molecular stability; plasma catalytic oxidation; quality control; X ray diffraction; air pollutant; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; Air Pollutants; Catalysis; Copper; Electrodes; Oxidation-Reduction; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; copper oxide, 1344-70-3; toluene, 108-88-3; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; cupric oxide, 1317-38-0; Air Pollutants; Copper; cupric oxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds","Funding text 1: catalyst.

The odorous compounds released from dewatered sludge can result in odor nuisance. This study concerns the use of flux hood chamber combined with proton transfer reaction—time of flight—mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) technique for periodical monitoring of odorous compounds emitted from aged, stabilized dewatered sludge samples from 2 different wastewater treatment plants located in Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland. Based on determined concentration of the chemical compounds and olfactory threshold values, theoretical odor concentrations (known also as “odor activity value” or “odor index”) were calculated for 17 selected odorous compounds. As a result, sulfur compounds such as diethyl sulphide, dimethyl sulphide, methanethiol, and ethanethiol were estimated as the most significant chemical compounds responsible for malodorous effect (average results, e.g., methanethiol, 178 ou/m 3 ; diethyl sulphide, 184 ou/m 3 ). Based on Pearson correlation coefficient, we revealed a correlation between odorous substances emitted from aged, stabilized dewatered sludge cakes. It was revealed that stabilized dewatered sludge still possessed significant amount of odorous compounds and applied measurement technique could be used for monitoring of odor concentration level of selected malodorous compounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flux Hood Chamber; Odors; Proton Transfer Reaction–mass Spectrometry; Sludge; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Dimethyl Sulfide; Methanethiol; Proton; Sulfide; Thiol Derivative; Air Pollutants; Diethyl Sulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Ethanethiol; Methylmercaptan; Protons; Sewage; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Water; Chemical Compound; Concentration (composition); Mass Spectrometry; Odor; Pollutant Source; Sludge; Stabilization; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Poland [central Europe]; Diethyl Sulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Ethanethiol; Fragrance; Methanethiol; Proton; Sulfide; Sulfur Derivative; Thiol Derivative; Air Pollutant; Analysis; Chemistry; Environmental Monitoring; Poland; Procedures; Sewage; Waste Water; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Mass Spectrometry; Odorants; Protons; Sewage; Smell; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water","chemical compound; concentration (composition); mass spectrometry; odor; pollutant source; sludge; stabilization; wastewater; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Poland [Central Europe]; diethyl sulfide; dimethyl sulfide; ethanethiol; fragrance; methanethiol; proton; sulfide; sulfur derivative; thiol derivative; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; Poland; procedures; sewage; waste water; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Mass Spectrometry; Odorants; Protons; Sewage; Smell; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water","","dimethyl sulfide, 75-18-3; methanethiol, 74-93-1; proton, 12408-02-5, 12586-59-3; sulfide, 18496-25-8; thiol derivative, 13940-21-1; Air Pollutants; diethyl sulfide; dimethyl sulfide; ethanethiol; methylmercaptan; Protons; Sewage; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Sulfur Compounds; Waste Water","Funding text 1: The investigations were financially supported by the Grant No. UMO-2015/19/B/ST4/02722 from the National Science Centre and by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (PIOF-GA-2013-622523 OdourCOB) within the seventh European Community Framework Programme.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgements The investigations were financially supported by the Grant No. UMO-2015/19/B/ST4/02722 from the National Science Centre and by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (PIOF-GA-2013-622523 OdourCOB) within the seventh European Community Framework Programme.","Water Environment Research Foundation Report, (2003); Añón, J.

The Ni/KKC provides a more conducive environment for gasification, resulting in larger amounts of syngas (H<inf>2</inf> and CO) in the product gases. Moreover, Ni impregnated with char may be the most inexpensive and effective solution for achieving maximum tar reduction and syngas generation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetaldehyde Removal; Biomass; Catalyst; Gasification; Kraft Lignin Char; Plasma; Acetaldehyde; Activated Carbon; Aluminum Oxide; Carbon Monoxide; Hydrogen; Lignin; Manganese; Nickel; Potassium Hydroxide; Silicon Dioxide; Acetaldehyde; Gases; Kraft Lignin; Lignin; Metals; Acetaldehyde; Aluminum Oxide; Catalyst Activity; Gasification; Lignin; Potassium Hydroxide; Synthesis Gas; Acetaldehyde Removal; Biomass Gasification; Gas Yields; Gasification Characteristics; Kraft Lignin; Kraft Lignin Char; Plasma Reactors; Syngas Contents; Yellow-poplar; ]+ Catalyst; Activated Carbon; Acetaldehyde; Activated Carbon; Aluminum Oxide; Carbon Monoxide; Hydrogen; Lignin; Manganese; Nickel; Potassium Hydroxide; Silicon Dioxide; Volatile Organic Compound; Metal; Biomass; Catalyst; Chemical Reaction; Plasma; Pollutant Removal; Reduction; Article; Chemical Composition; Gasification; Surface Area; Synthesis; Catalysis; Gas; Liriodendron Tulipifera; Biomass; Catalysis; Gases; Metals","Acetaldehyde; Aluminum oxide; Catalyst activity; Gasification; Lignin; Potassium hydroxide; Synthesis gas; Acetaldehyde removal; Biomass Gasification; Gas yields; Gasification characteristics; Kraft lignin; Kraft lignin char; Plasma reactors; Syngas contents; Yellow-poplar; ]+ catalyst; Activated carbon; acetaldehyde; activated carbon; aluminum oxide; carbon monoxide; hydrogen; lignin; manganese; nickel; potassium hydroxide; silicon dioxide; volatile organic compound; metal; biomass; catalyst; chemical reaction; plasma; pollutant removal; reduction; Article; chemical composition; gasification; surface area; synthesis; catalysis; gas; Liriodendron tulipifera; Biomass; Catalysis; Gases; Metals","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; activated carbon, 64365-11-3, 82228-96-4; aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0; lignin, 9005-53-2; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; nickel, 7440-02-0; potassium hydroxide, 1310-58-3; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Acetaldehyde; Gases; Kraft lignin; Lignin; Metals","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Nano·Material Technology Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2016M3A7B4904328).

In order to enhance the degradation efficiency of electro-oxidation, a novel enhanced Ti/PbO<inf>2</inf> electro-catalytic tubular reactor prepared by using flow dynamic electrodeposition was designed and applied as pretreatment process for CH<inf>3</inf>SNa wastewater. The results indicated that the optimal condition was 7 mA cm−2 of current density, 10 g L−1 of initial concentration of CH<inf>3</inf>SNa, 9.0 of pH and 5.0 g L−1 of electrolyte concentration. Addition of Fe2+ and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and mechanism of COTR system were first put forward. The target species CH<inf>3</inf>SNa were removed over 90% by this process. In order to treat the CH<inf>3</inf>SH effusion which was co-produced with CH<inf>3</inf>SNa aqueous solution, the technology of NTP-DBD catalytic plasma reactor followed by a chemical absorption has been developed. MSH could be removed over 95% under the condition of 2 s of residence time, 15 kV of output voltage with oxygen concentration of 9%. Moreover, the synthetic Ni-doped AC catalyst had the best performance under 0.7 mmol g−1 of nickel loading. The conclusion was the energetic electrons generated in the DBD reactor played a key role on the removal of MSH, and the major decomposition products of MSH were detected as CH<inf>3</inf>SSCH<inf>3</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>. Moreover, the gaseous products in the plasma exhaust could be absorbed and fixed by the subsequent aqueous NaOH solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coupled-oxidation Tubular Reactor; Energetic Electrons; Non-thermal Dbd Plasma; Odorous Mercaptans; Synergistic Electro-catalysis; Deferiprone; Ferrous Ion; Intermedin; Thiol Derivative; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Catalysis; Degradation; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Electric Discharges; Electrolytes; Electron Scattering; Electrooxidation; Iron Compounds; Oxidation; Plasma Applications; Sodium Hydroxide; Dbd Plasma; Decomposition Products; Degradation Efficiency; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Electrolyte Concentration; Energetic Electron; Odorous Mercaptans; Tubular Reactors; Catalytic Oxidation; Deferiprone; Electrolyte; Ferrous Ion; Intermedin; Thiol Derivative; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Catalysis; Decomposition; Electrokinesis; Electron; Instrumentation; Odor; Organic Compound; Oxidation; Plasma; Wastewater Treatment; Aqueous Solution; Article; Catalyst; Current Density; Electricity; Energy Consumption; Oxygen Concentration; Retention Time; Surface Area; Surface Property; Target Organism; Waste Water Management; Chemistry; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Electrons; Oxidation-reduction; Sulfhydryl Compounds","Catalysis; Degradation; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Electron scattering; Electrooxidation; Iron compounds; Oxidation; Plasma applications; Sodium hydroxide; DBD plasma; Decomposition products; Degradation efficiency; Dielectric barrier discharges; Electrolyte concentration; Energetic electron; Odorous mercaptans; Tubular reactors; Catalytic oxidation; deferiprone; electrolyte; ferrous ion; intermedin; thiol derivative; titanium; titanium dioxide; catalysis; decomposition; electrokinesis; electron; instrumentation; odor; organic compound; oxidation; plasma; wastewater treatment; aqueous solution; Article; catalyst; current density; electricity; energy consumption; oxygen concentration; retention time; surface area; surface property; target organism; waste water management; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; Electrons; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfhydryl Compounds","","deferiprone, 30652-11-0; ferrous ion, 15438-31-0; intermedin, 9002-79-3, 9046-72-4; thiol derivative, 13940-21-1; titanium, 7440-32-6; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; Sulfhydryl Compounds","Financial support was obtained from National Science Technology Support Plan of China ( 2014BAC08B03 ) and Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51578287 ).

It also increases the risk of VOCs emission instead of their treatment when using open air biological technologies. In the present study, different types of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) were investigated for the degradation of several VOCs in a model pilot scale effluent, simulating effluents from bitumen production. The goal of this paper is to reach effective VOCs and wastewater degradation to make the bitumen production a cleaner process. O<inf>3</inf>, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>3</inf>/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (the so called peroxone), persulfate (PS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) were processes chosen for this work. Heat activation enhanced the total VOCs degradation in PS and PMS technologies, which achieved higher effectiveness than H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. Peroxone process at 40 °C achieved the highest efficiency of all processes studied needing only 60 min to completely degrade all compounds without any oxidation by-products. Sulfur containing VOCs (VSCs) were completely degraded in a shorter treatment time and nitrogen containing VOCs (VNCs) needed more time of treatment in all technologies studied. The preference of the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals for degradation of oxygen containing VOCs (O–VOCs) had different behavior depending on the group of compounds and should be considered in future research for combined radical processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aops; Gc-ms; Hydroxyl Radicals; Sulfate Radicals; Vocs Degradation; Wastewater Treatment; Bituminous Materials; Degradation; Oxidation; Sulfur Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Advanced Oxidation Process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Aops; Biological Technology; Gc-ms; Hydroxyl Radicals; Oxidation By-products; Sulfate Radicals; Effluents","Bituminous materials; Degradation; Oxidation; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Advanced oxidation process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; AOPs; Biological technology; GC-MS; Hydroxyl radicals; Oxidation by-products; Sulfate radicals; Effluents","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Science Centre (Narodowe Centrum Nauki), Warsaw, Poland – decision no.

Both ethyl acetate and toluene could be removed efficiently using this coupled process due to the generation of SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]− and HO[rad]. The mass-transfer coefficients in this coupled process were larger than in wet scrubbing only process. The roles of SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]− and HO[rad] were investigated, in which SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]− acted as the predominant radical for toluene degradation while HO[rad] was major for ethyl acetate. This could be further confirmed by simultaneous degradation of ethyl and toluene. Moreover, the reaction solution reused at least four times still showed excellent performance for VOCs removal via re-adding PMS. A possible mechanism on toluene degradation was proposed based on the evolutions of intermediates during the process. This study clarified the roles of non-selective radical (i.e. HO[rad]) and selective radical (i.e. SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]− and Cl[rad]) in the removal of a continuous-flow gaseous VOCs by this coupled process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Oxidation Processes; Uv/pms; Vocs Elimination; Wet Scrubbing Process; Batch Data Processing; Biodegradation; Mass Transfer; Sulfur Compounds; Toluene; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Possible Mechanisms; Reaction Solutions; Semi-batch Process; Simultaneous Degradation; Toluene Degradations; Uv/pms; Wet Scrubbing; Scrubbers","Batch data processing; Biodegradation; Mass transfer; Sulfur compounds; Toluene; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Possible mechanisms; Reaction solutions; Semi-batch process; Simultaneous degradation; Toluene degradations; UV/PMS; Wet scrubbing; Scrubbers","","","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21677179 and 21506054 ) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0204800 ), Guangdong Applied Science and Technology Research & Development Fund (No. 2015B020236004 ), Guangzhou Science and Technology Project (No. 201504301654288 ), the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme (No. 51561165015, No. N_HKU718/15), Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Support Program (GHP/025/16GD) and the Key Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (17lgjc17).","Añón, J.

Of these applications, they are particularly attractive for uses in chemical sensors for environmental and health monitoring. However, chemical sensors based on CNTs are often lacking in selectivity, and the elucidation of their sensing mechanisms remains challenging. This review is a comprehensive description of the parameters that give rise to the sensing capabilities of CNT-based sensors and the application of CNT-based devices in chemical sensing. This review begins with the discussion of the sensing mechanisms in CNT-based devices, the chemical methods of CNT functionalization, architectures of sensors, performance parameters, and theoretical models used to describe CNT sensors. It then discusses the expansive applications of CNT-based sensors to multiple areas including environmental monitoring, food and agriculture applications, biological sensors, and national security. The discussion of each analyte focuses on the strategies used to impart selectivity and the molecular interactions between the selector and the analyte. Finally, the review concludes with a brief outlook over future developments in the field of chemical sensors and their prospects for commercialization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nanotubes, Carbon; Chemical Sensors; National Security; Yarn; Agriculture Applications; Biological Sensors; Chemical Sensing; Cnt Functionalization; Environmental Monitoring; Health Monitoring; Performance Parameters; Sensing Mechanism; Carbon Nanotubes; Carbon Nanotube; Chemistry; Environmental Monitoring; Food Analysis; Genetic Procedures; Human; Nanotechnology; Biosensing Techniques; Food Analysis; Humans; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes, Carbon","Chemical sensors; National security; Yarn; Agriculture applications; Biological sensors; Chemical sensing; CNT functionalization; Environmental Monitoring; Health monitoring; Performance parameters; Sensing mechanism; Carbon nanotubes; carbon nanotube; chemistry; environmental monitoring; food analysis; genetic procedures; human; nanotechnology; Biosensing Techniques; Food Analysis; Humans; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes, Carbon","","Nanotubes, Carbon","Funding text 1: The authors of this article were supported by the KAUST sensor project CRF-2015-SENSORS2719 and the Army Research Office through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies and National Science Foundation (DMR-1410718).

The presence of plasma can alter the elementary steps in catalysis. The type of catalysts also provides substantial changes in plasma properties. This chapter reviews the current progress in the experimental observations and the understanding of bilateral interactions of NTP with catalysts. Among the various types of combinations, this chapter will mostly focus on the single-stage plasma-driven catalysis. Several lines of the experimental evidence on the interaction are introduced: type of reactor, propagation of discharge streamer, key components of plasma, and catalyst durability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP26400539.","Añón, J.

Most texts lack examples of how these equations and formulae apply to the quantification of real-world scenarios and conditions. The ample example calculations apply to current air quality problems, including emission inventories, risk estimations, biogeochemical cycling assessments, and efficiencies in air pollution control technologies. In addition, the book explains thermodynamics and fluid dynamics in step-by-step and understandable calculations using air quality and multimedia modeling, reliability engineering and engineering economics using practical examples likely to be encountered by scientists, engineers, managers and decision makers. The book touches on the environmental variables, constraints and drivers that can influence pollutant mass, volume and concentrations, which in turn determine toxicity and adverse outcomes caused by air pollution. How the pollutants form, move, partition, transform and find their fate are explained using the entire range of atmospheric phenomena. The control, prevention and mitigation of air pollution are explained based on physical, chemical and biological principles which is crucial to science-based policy and decision-making. Users will find this to be a comprehensive, single resource that will help them understand air pollution, quantify existing data, and help those whose work is impacted by air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Terms of Environment, (2018); Laudato Si on Care for Our Common Home, (2015); Social Aspects of Environmental Pollution, (1971); Añón, J.

It is a promising technology for air purification because it can decompose gaseous pollutants (particularly volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) directly into harmless CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O under ambient conditions. Photocatalysis can be particularly suitable for removing low concentration pollutants (sub-ppm levels) in indoor environments where conventional adsorption technologies are not very efficient. Although photocatalytic air purification has been extensively investigated, it still falls far short of satisfying the requirements for practical usage. This review focuses on two main critical issues for improving the applicability of photocatalytic air purification: (1) increasing visible light activity to utilize ambient light and (2) preventing catalyst deactivation that hinders long-term usage of photocatalysts. Literature reports on the photocatalytic degradation of VOCs using visible light are surveyed and systematically categorized based on the type of photocatalytic materials and VOCs. Strategies taken to significantly increase the efficiency of visible light photocatalysts are introduced. On the other hand, photocatalyst deactivation processes are discussed according to the kinds of air pollutants, and various methods of assessing the extent of photocatalyst deactivation are outlined. The development of deactivation-resistant photocatalysts and their applications to air purification are also introduced and discussed. Finally, the status and the problems of the current research on photocatalytic air purification are critically discussed and suggestions for future studies of photocatalytic air purification are made. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst Deactivation; Fog; Indoor Air Pollution; Light; Nanotechnology; Photocatalytic Activity; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption Technology; Ambient Conditions; Deactivation Process; Photo Catalytic Degradation; Photocatalytic Materials; Semiconductor Nanoparticles; Visible-light Activity; Visible-light Photocatalysts; Air Cleaners; Ambient Air; Atmospheric Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Catalyst; Concentration (composition); Nanotechnology; Purification; Volatile Organic Compound","Catalyst deactivation; Fog; Indoor air pollution; Light; Nanotechnology; Photocatalytic activity; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption technology; Ambient conditions; Deactivation process; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalytic materials; Semiconductor nanoparticles; Visible-light activity; Visible-light photocatalysts; Air cleaners; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; catalyst; concentration (composition); nanotechnology; purification; volatile organic compound","","","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the Global Research Laboratory (GRL) program (2014K1A1A2041044) and the Korea Research Fellowship Program (2018H1D3A1A02038503), which were funded by the Korea government (MSICT) through the National Research Foundation (NRF).; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the Global Research Laboratory (GRL) program (2014K1A1A2041044) and the Korea Research Fellowship Program (2018H1D3A1A02038503), which were funded by the Korea government (MSICT) through the National Research Foundation (NRF)","Añón, J.

Mainly, infrastructure can be divided into two categories: hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. Physical infrastructure, such as buildings, roads, and water supplying systems, belongs to hard infrastructure. Soft infrastructure includes services which are required to maintain economic, health, cultural and social standards of animal husbandry. Therefore, the proper management of infrastructure in animal husbandry is necessary for animal welfare and its economy. Among various technologies to improve the quality of infrastructure, non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology is an effectively applicable technology in different stages of animal husbandry. NTP is mainly helpful in maintaining better health conditions of animals in several ways via decontamination from microorganisms present in air, water, food, instruments and surfaces of animal farming systems. Furthermore, NTP is used in the treatment of waste water, vaccine production, wound healing in animals, odorfree ventilation, and packaging of animal food or animal products. This review summarizes the recent studies of NTP which can be related to the infrastructure in animal husbandry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal Husbandry; Infrastructure; Non-thermal Plasma; Products; Review; Technology; Temefos; Water; Plasma Gases; Water; Inactivated Vaccine; Temefos; Volatile Organic Compound; Water; Aerosol; Air; Air Conditioning; Animal Food; Animal Husbandry; Animal Product; Animal Welfare; Decontamination; Devices; Economic Aspect; Effluent; Environment; Farm Animal; Farming System; Food; Food Packaging; Nonhuman; Odor; Plasma Gas; Review; Skin Decontamination; Skin Injury; Surface Property; Technology; Vaccine Production; Waste Water; Wound Healing; Air Pollution; Animal; Chemistry; Domestic Animal; Microbiology; Microclimate; Air Pollution; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Environment, Controlled; Plasma Gases; Water; Water Microbiology","inactivated vaccine; temefos; volatile organic compound; water; aerosol; air; air conditioning; animal food; animal husbandry; animal product; animal welfare; decontamination; devices; economic aspect; effluent; environment; farm animal; farming system; food; food packaging; nonhuman; odor; plasma gas; Review; skin decontamination; skin injury; surface property; technology; vaccine production; waste water; wound healing; air pollution; animal; chemistry; domestic animal; microbiology; microclimate; Air Pollution; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Environment, Controlled; Plasma Gases; Water; Water Microbiology","","temefos, 3383-96-8; water, 7732-18-5; Plasma Gases; Water","This study was supported by grants from the KRIBB Research Initiative Program (KGM5161914).

The addition of a non-aqueous-phase (NAP) with a high affinity for the gas pollutant to packed bed or suspended-growth bioreactor configurations has resulted in enhanced elimination capacities and process robustness. Despite recent research has just added more desired characteristics to the selection criteria of the optimum NAP in gas treatment applications, silicone oil continues being the most popular mass transfer vector. This technology has been successfully applied to the treatment of hexane, methane, styrene, alpha-pinene and BTEX in biofilters, biotrickling filters, stirred tank and airlift bioreactors. The maximum potential of two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) during off-gas treatment is achieved when the microbial community is confined inside the NAP. TPPB modeling has also experienced significant advances, the most advanced platforms being able to describe the recent findings in the field.

A low-temperature and normal operating pressure are the main advantages of these processes, but a limited energy efficiency and little selectivity control hinder their practical implementation. In this work, we propose the use of isotope labelling to retrieve information about the intermediate reactions that may intervene during the DBD processes contributing to a decrease in their energy efficiency. The results are shown for the wet reforming reaction of methane, using D<inf>2</inf>O instead of H<inf>2</inf>O as reactant, and for the ammonia synthesis, using NH<inf>3</inf>/D<inf>2</inf>/N<inf>2</inf> mixtures. In the two cases, it was found that a significant amount of outlet gas molecules, either reactants or products, have deuterium in their structure (e.g., HD for hydrogen, CD<inf>x</inf>H<inf>y</inf> for methane, or ND<inf>x</inf>H<inf>y</inf> for ammonia). From the analysis of the evolution of the labelled molecules as a function of power, useful information has been obtained about the exchange events of H by D atoms (or vice versa) between the plasma intermediate species. An evaluation of the number of these events revealed a significant progression with the plasma power, a tendency that is recognized to be detrimental for the energy efficiency of reactant to product transformation. The labelling technique is proposed as a useful approach for the analysis of plasma reaction mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonia Synthesis; Dielectric Barrier Discharge (dbd); Isotope Labelling; Methane Reforming; Plasma Catalysis","","","","The authors thank the European Regional Development Funds program (EU-FEDER) and the MINECO-AEI (201560E055 and MAT2016-79866-R and network MAT2015-69035-REDC) for financial support.","Añón, J.

Reduction of ethylene concentrations around these commodities may lead to the slowing down of metabolic processes, which could potentially extend their storage or shelf life. The objective of this work was to investigate photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) and vacuum ultraviolet light (VUV) photolysis for ethylene removal in fruit storage. The efficacy of both techniques for ethylene removal was analyzed under different storage conditions (initial ethylene concentration, oxygen, relative humidity and temperature). Ethylene removal in VUV photolysis was much faster than PCO with the reaction mechanism followed by Langmuir-Hinshelwood and first-order equations, respectively. Higher O<inf>2</inf> concentration in the reactor favored both ethylene removal processes. However, high relative humidity impeded PCO and enhanced VUV photolysis efficacy of ethylene oxidation. Lowering the temperature from 21 °C to 1 °C showed no consistent trend of temperature effects on ethylene removal in the PCO process, whereas in VUV photolysis, reducing the temperature decreased ethylene removal significantly (p ≤ 0.05). Ethylene removal in a gas stream with a single pass through VUV photolysis reactor was 84.8% whereas it was only 14.9% in PCO reactor. Apple storage revealed that the ethylene concentration increased to 70 μL L−1 in 8 days at 1 °C. This concentration was brought down to 24 and 2.6 μL L−1 in storage chambers connected to PCO and VUV reactors, respectively. Further research efforts are needed to improve the performance of the reactors for the complete removal of ethylene in postharvest storage of fresh produce. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fresh Produce; Fruit And Vegetables; Postharvest; Storage; Titanium Dioxide","","","","Financial support provided by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) [ ICAR-IF 2014-15 , F.

These bacteria can invade periodontal tissues, form plaques, and produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) that was specifically produced in egg yolks after chickens were challenged with P. gingivalis could control and prevent oral diseases caused by P. gingivalis. The releases of P. gingivalis offensive metabolic odors in vitro and in vivo were determined using a Halimeter and GCMS. With IgY bacterial growth was inhibited, and the relative amounts of VOC and VSC were decreased. The scores for the oral health index and the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α are also decreased.

In the past few years, several studies have been made to assess the feasibility of PCO for the removal of VOCs that are commonly found in most indoor environments like homes and schools. There are however little or no studies on other indoor environments like hospitals. In hospital operating rooms, anesthetic gases such as isoflurane are known to be one of the main pollutants found in the air. The present work therefore studies the efficiency of PCO to remove isoflurane by studying the influence of three operating parameters on the degradation process. The operating parameters investigated were air velocity, light intensity and initial concentration. The experiments were carried out in a closed-loop multi pass reactor. The kinetic degradation curve of isoflurane showed two distinct phases; the first phase where the degradation occurred slowly and a second phase where the degradation accelerated and fit a first order decay model. Two quantitative indicators, the induction time and the single pass removal efficiency were chosen to compare the influence of the parameters on the first and second phases respectively. Increasing the air velocity led to longer induction periods and lower single pass removal efficiencies. Induction period was decreased when light intensity was increased and removal efficiencies increased by half order. Lower induction periods and better removal efficiencies were obtained at lower concentrations. Although some intermediates were identified, their low concentrations mean they may not pose significant negative effects to human health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hospital; Indoor Air Purification; Isoflurane; Operating Rooms; Pco; Air; Air Cleaners; Air Quality; Energy Efficiency; Hospitals; Indoor Air Pollution; Operating Rooms; Removal; Degradation Process; First-order Decays; Initial Concentration; Isoflurane; Operating Parameters; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Quantitative Indicators; Removal Efficiencies; Anesthetics","Air; Air cleaners; Air quality; Energy efficiency; Hospitals; Indoor air pollution; Operating rooms; Removal; Degradation process; First-order decays; Initial concentration; Isoflurane; Operating parameters; Photocatalytic oxidations; Quantitative indicators; Removal efficiencies; Anesthetics","","","","Añón, J.

These VOCs are responsible for photo chemical reaction in atmosphere leading to serious harmful effects on human health and environment. VOCs are produced from both natural and man-made sources and may have good commercial value if it can be utilized as alternate fuel. As per data from US EPA, 15% of total VOC emissions are generated from surface coating industry but VOC concentration and exhaust air volume varies to a great extent and is dependent on processes used by industry. Various technologies are available for abatement of VOCs. Physical, Chemical and Biological technologies are available to remove VOCs by either recovery or destruction with many advantages and limitations. With growing environmental awareness and considering the resource limitations of medium and small scale industries, requirement of a tool for selecting appropriate techno economically viable solution for removal of VOCs from industrial process exhaust is envisaged. The aim of the present study is to provide management a tool to determine the overall effect of implementation of VOC abatement technology on business performance and VOC emissions. The primary purpose of this work is to outline a methodology to rate various VOC abatement technologies with respect to the constraint of meeting current and foreseeable future regulatory requirements, operational flexibility and Over All Economics Parameters considering conservation of energy.

The non-stoichiometric effect of the La<inf>x</inf>MnO<inf>3</inf> catalysts on the removal of H<inf>2</inf>S and sulfur balance in the plasma-catalytic process has been investigated as a function of specific energy density (SED). The integration of the plasma with the La<inf>x</inf>MnO<inf>3</inf> catalysts significantly enhanced the reaction performance compared to the process using plasma alone. The highest H<inf>2</inf>S removal of 96.4% and sulfur balance of 90.5% were achieved over the La<inf>0.90</inf>MnO<inf>3</inf> catalyst, while the major products included SO<inf>2</inf> and SO<inf>3</inf>. The missing sulfur could be ascribed to the sulfur deposited on the catalyst surfaces. The non-stoichiometric La<inf>x</inf>MnO<inf>3</inf> catalyst exhibited larger specific surface areas and smaller crystallite sizes compared to the LaMnO<inf>3</inf> catalyst. The non-stoichiometric effect changed their redox properties as the decreased La/Mn ratio favored the transformation of Mn3+ to Mn4+, which contributed to the generation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surfaces. The XPS and H<inf>2</inf>-TPR results confirmed that the Mn-rich catalysts showed the higher relative concentration of surface adsorbed oxygen (O<inf>ads</inf>) and lower reduction temperature compared to LaMnO<inf>3</inf> catalyst.

Waste gases polluted with multiple VOCs often need to be purified simultaneously in biofilters, which may lead to antagonistic, neutral, or synergistic effects on removal performance. Antagonism limits the application of biofilters to simultaneous treatment of multiple VOCs, while synergism has not yet been fully exploited. We review the interactions among multiple target pollutants and the changes in the bioavailability and biodegradability of substrates that are responsible for substrate interactions. Potential strategies for enhancing biofilter performance are then discussed.

To avoid this issue, we proposed a novel method for a typical gaseous VOC (toluene) degradation via catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in the liquid phase. Herein, activated carbon supported monodispersed Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles (Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/AC) were prepared via a facile deposition method. It is highly efficient in PMS activation for toluene degradation due to the presence of Co-OH+ species and well dispersed Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> on Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/AC. A toluene removal efficiency of nearly 90% was maintained during the reaction, and few gaseous intermediates were discharged. Sulfate radical (SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]−) and hydroxyl radical (HO[rad]) derived from PMS activation played different roles during toluene oxidation and mineralization. Electron spin resonance (EPR) suggested that the generation of plentiful SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]− resulted in the superior toluene degradation, and the presence of HO[rad] can improve carbon mineralization. Radical quenching tests further confirmed that SO<inf>4</inf>[rad]− played a dominant role for toluene degradation, whereas the absence of HO[rad] inhibited the carbon mineralization. The toluene degradation pathway in the Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/AC-PMS system was proposed based on the intermediates identified by GC–MS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cobalt Oxide; Hydroxyl Radical; Oxone; Sulfate Radical; Vocs Elimination; Activated Carbon; Biodegradation; Chemical Activation; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Magnetic Moments; Mineralogy; Reaction Intermediates; Sulfur Compounds; Toluene; Activated Carbon Supported; Carbon Mineralization; Cobalt Oxides; Hydroxyl Radicals; Oxone; Sulfate Radicals; Toluene Degradation Pathways; Toluene Removal Efficiency; Cobalt Compounds","Activated carbon; Biodegradation; Chemical activation; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Magnetic moments; Mineralogy; Reaction intermediates; Sulfur compounds; Toluene; Activated carbon supported; Carbon mineralization; Cobalt oxides; Hydroxyl radicals; Oxone; Sulfate radicals; Toluene degradation pathways; Toluene removal efficiency; Cobalt compounds","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0204800 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme (No. 51561165015 and No. N_HKU718/15), NSFC (21677179), the Guangdong Special Fund for Science & Technology Development (Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme) (No. 2016A050503022), the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Support Program (GHP/025/16GD), and the Innovation Platform Construction of Guangdong and Hong Kong (No. 2017B050504001) and Guangzhou Science and Technology Project (No. 2060404).","Yoon, Jaewon, Colorimetric sensors for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) based on conjugated polymer-embedded electrospun fibers, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 129, 11, pp. 3038-3039, (2007); Añón, J.

In this study, 27 typical VOCs, including 11 hydrocarbons and 16 hydrocarbon derivatives, at 150–200 ppm in air and nitrogen gas were treated by a laboratory-scale UV reactor with 185/254 nm irradiation to systematically investigate their removal and conversion by UV irradiation. For the tested 27 VOCs, the VOC removal efficiencies in air were within the range of 13%–97% (with an average of 80%) at a retention time of 53 s, which showed a moderate positive correlation with the molecular weight of the VOCs (R = 0.53). The respective contributions of photolysis and photooxidation to VOC removal were identified for each VOC. According to the CO<inf>2</inf> results, the mineralization rate of the tested VOCs was within the range of 9%–90%, with an average of 41% and were negatively correlated to the molecular weight (R = −0.63). Many of the tested VOCs exhibited high concentration particulate matters in the off-gases with a 3–283 mg/m3 PM<inf>10</inf> range and a 2–40 mg/m3 PM<inf>2.5</inf> range. The carbon balance of each VOC during UVirradiation was analyzed based on the VOC, CO<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations. Certain organic intermediates and 23–218 ppm ozone were also identified in the off-gases. Although the UV technique exhibited a high VOC removal efficiency, its drawbacks, specifically low mineralization, particulate matters production, and ozone emission, must be considered prior to its application in VOC gas treatments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ozone; Particulate Matters; Uv Photodegradation; Vocs; Carbon Dioxide; Efficiency; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Mineralogy; Molecular Weight; Nitrogen Removal; Ozone; Particles (particulate Matter); Photolysis; Photooxidation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Its Applications; Organic Intermediates; Particulate Matter; Pm10 Concentration; Positive Correlations; Removal Performance; Ultraviolet Irradiations; Volatile Organic Compound (voc); Irradiation","Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Mineralogy; Molecular weight; Nitrogen removal; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Photolysis; Photooxidation; Volatile organic compounds; ITS applications; Organic intermediates; Particulate Matter; PM10 concentration; Positive correlations; Removal performance; Ultraviolet irradiations; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Irradiation","","","Acknowledgements This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.51378286) and the Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control (No. 2011ZX07301-003).

We have previously reported the use of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) modified biodegradable poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles for the capture of volatile aldehydes and carboxylic acids in the gas phase. In this study we evaluated the performance of amine-decorated cellulose materials by grafting three stable amine-bearing molecules (i. e. ethylendiamine (EDA), tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (Tris), and PEI) to the surface of cellulose micro and nanocrystals using a convenient two step protocol. The amine-modified cellulose materials were then characterized using TGA, FTIR, EDS, and elemental analysis. GC headspace experiments were conducted to assess the ability of the amine-modified cellulose materials to capture two illustrative aldehyde VOCs, hexanal and octanal, in the gas phase. PEI-cellulose nanocrystals successfully captured gaseous hexanal, and significantly outperformed related PEI-cellulose microcrystals. In a second round of optimization, cellulose nanocrystals modified with simpler amine-bearing molecules, Tris and EDA, were prepared for comparison. Tris and EDA modified cellulose nanocrystals also efficiently captured the target VOCs. These results demonstrate that the size of cellulose substrate and the chemical composition of the amine molecules on the surface are critical parameters for efficient contaminant capture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellulose; Gas Capture; Remediation; Surface Functionalization; Targeting","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Fats & Proteins Research Foundation, Inc., the Poultry Protein & Fat Council, the Clemson University Animal Co-Products Research and Education Center, and the Clemson University Research Foundation for generous funding.

The halogen VOCs have reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. The traditional methods for treating them include masking method, dilution method, chemical oxidation method, incineration method, UV oxidation method, photocatalytic oxidation method, absorption method, and biological method. In this paper, advantages and disadvantages of traditional methods have been studied and analyzed. A new plasma technology has been put forward, which has the advantage of the rapid reaction to ambient temperature, wide applications, system compactness, simplicity of operation and short residual time, and the plasma technology is especially appropriate for the decomposition of VOCs. At present, as for the control of VOCs, the plasma technology has drawn much attention as an energy-saving technology. In this paper, the equipment for the decomposition of halogen VOCs has been analyzed, including the plasma rectors, power characteristics, operation conditions, and the decomposition mechanisms of C<inf>2</inf>HCl<inf>3</inf>, CH<inf>2</inf>Cl<inf>2</inf>, C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>3</inf>Cl<inf>3</inf>, CCl<inf>4</inf>, CHCl<inf>3</inf>, CF<inf>4</inf>, C<inf>2</inf>F<inf>6</inf>, and SF<inf>6</inf> have been investigated and concluded.

Regarding complexity of the waste gas mixture, low concentration levels of the single compounds, and their high odor relevance, non-thermal plasma (NTP) processes are an adequate technique for the treatment of such emissions. However, performance tests of NTPs were mainly carried out with artificial low-volume gas flows and highly experimental plasma catalysts. A combined process of a non-thermal plasma and a readily available low-cost halloysite-containing mineral adsorber for VOCs removal and odor abatement was tested for emission treatment of two organic waste treatment plants. The process revealed average removal rates for VOCs, ammonia, and methane of 62.9 %, 15.9 %, and 30.1 % at the first site and 43.2 %, 22.2 %, and 34.8 % at the second site at specific input energy (SIE) levels of 2.1-2.2 kWh 1000 m-3.

Conventional biochemical methods are often destructive, time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, VOC analysis of headspace over cultures may offer a non-destructive alternative for the monitoring of cell proliferation and metabolism. VOC profiles from cultures of murine pluripotent stem cells and fibroblasts were assessed every 24 h for 3 days. Pure cell media were measured as parallel controls. VOC analysis was highly standardized with respect to time of measurement and phases of cell growth. Cultures were grown in custom-made inert boxes. In order to determine the effects of fresh media supply on VOC emissions, both cell types were cultured with and without daily media exchange. VOCs from headspace were preconcentrated by means of needle trap micro-extraction and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Murine pluripotent stem cells emitted increasing concentrations of thiirane and methyl-methoxy-hydroxy-methyl-amine (MMHA). Substance concentration correlated with cell numbers. Murine fibroblasts did not emit thiirane or MMHA. Concentrations of aldehydes, especially benzaldehyde, were lower in both cell cultures than in pure media samples. Daily media exchange resulted in higher cell numbers, but had no major effects on VOC concentrations emitted from the cells. Investigation and monitoring of volatile substances such as thiirane and MMHA may enhance the understanding of stem cell properties and lead to a destruction-free characterization of pluripotent stem cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gc-ms; Needle Trap Device; Proliferation; Stem Cell; Voc; Benzaldehyde; Sulfide; Aldehydes; Amines; Ethylene Sulfide; Sulfides; Volatile Organic Compounds; Aldehyde; Benzaldehyde; Methylmethoxyhydroxymethylamine; Thiirane; Unclassified Drug; Volatile Organic Compound; Amine; Ethylene Sulfide; Sulfide; Animal Cell; Article; Cell Count; Cell Culture; Cell Growth; Cell Proliferation; Chemical Analysis; Controlled Study; Fibroblast; Mass Fragmentography; Nonhuman; Pluripotent Stem Cell; Priority Journal; Animal; Breath Analysis; Cytology; Limit Of Detection; Mouse; Odor; Stem Cell; Aldehydes; Amines; Animals; Breath Tests; Cell Count; Cell Proliferation; Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Limit Of Detection; Mice; Smell; Stem Cells; Sulfides; Volatile Organic Compounds","aldehyde; benzaldehyde; methylmethoxyhydroxymethylamine; thiirane; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; amine; ethylene sulfide; sulfide; animal cell; Article; cell count; cell culture; cell growth; cell proliferation; chemical analysis; controlled study; fibroblast; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; animal; breath analysis; cytology; limit of detection; mouse; odor; stem cell; Aldehydes; Amines; Animals; Breath Tests; Cell Count; Cell Proliferation; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Limit of Detection; Mice; Smell; Stem Cells; Sulfides; Volatile Organic Compounds","","benzaldehyde, 100-52-7; sulfide, 18496-25-8; Aldehydes; Amines; ethylene sulfide; Sulfides; Volatile Organic Compounds","","Añón, J.

The plasma reactor is used to remove methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) from humid artificial air (≈ 50 % r.h.). A 70 % removal from 100 ppm MEK was achieved with the surface discharge alone operated at a specific input energy of SIE ≈ 0.67 kJ/L. Energizing the extraction electrode to generate electric wind increased the removal to 95 %. The decomposed MEK was mainly oxidized to CO<inf>2</inf>, CO and water. The applied electric wind also leads to significant deflection of smoke particles added to the gas stream. The deflecting electric wind, perpendicular to the gas stream, was found to reach velocities of up to 0.8 m/s. Furthermore, the measured velocities depend on the polarity of the extraction electrode because of the different ion mobilities for positive and negative ions in air. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electric Wind; Mek; Non-thermal Plasma; Odour Removal; Surface Discharge","","","","The authors like to thank Mr. Wolfgang Reich and Dr. Milko Schiorlin for technical assistance and fruitful discussions and Prof. Klaus-Dieter Weltmann for his kind support.

Therefore, understanding of BVOC emissions from all abundant plant species at all developmental stages is very important. Nevertheless, investigations on BVOC emissions from even the most widespread agricultural crop species are rare and mainly confined to the healthy green leaves. Senescent leaves of grain crop species could be an important source of BVOCs as almost all the leaves senesce on the field before being harvested. For these reasons, BVOC emission measurements have been performed on maize (Zea mays L.), one of the most cultivated crop species in the world, at all the leaf developmental stages. The measurements were performed in controlled environmental conditions using dynamic enclosures and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). The main compounds emitted by senescent maize leaves were methanol (31% of the total cumulative BVOC emission on a mass of compound basis) and acetic acid (30%), followed by acetaldehyde (11%), hexenals (9%) and m/z 59 compounds (acetone/propanal) (7%). Important differences were observed in the temporal emission profiles of the compounds, and both yellow leaves during chlorosis and dry brown leaves after chlorosis were identified as important senescence-related BVOC sources. Total cumulative BVOC emissions from senescent maize leaves were found to be among the highest for senescent Poaceae plant species. BVOC emission rates varied strongly among the different leaf developmental stages, and senescent leaves showed a larger diversity of emitted compounds than leaves at earlier stages. Methanol was the compound with the highest emissions for all the leaf developmental stages and the contribution from the young-growing, mature, and senescent stages to the total methanol emission by a typical maize leaf was 61, 13, and 26%, respectively. This study shows that BVOC emissions from senescent maize leaves cannot be neglected and further investigations in field conditions are recommended to further constrain the BVOC emissions from this important C4 crop species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bvoc; Glv; Leaf Senescence; Maize; Methanol; Ptr-ms; Acetaldehyde; Acetic Acid; Acetone; Hexobarbital; Methanol; Propionaldehyde; Acetone; Atmospheric Chemistry; Atmospheric Composition; Crops; Cultivation; Grain (agricultural Product); Mass Spectrometry; Methanol; Organic Compounds; Proton Transfer; Volatile Organic Compounds; Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds; Bvoc; Emission Measurement; Environmental Conditions; Leaf Senescence; Maize; Proton-transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometries; Ptr-ms; Plants (botany); Acetaldehyde; Acetic Acid; Acetone; Hexobarbital; Methanol; Propionaldehyde; Terpene; Volatile Organic Compound; Atmospheric Chemistry; Biogenic Emission; Cereal; Developmental Stage; Environmental Conditions; Maize; Senescence; Article; Chlorosis; Degeneration; Leaf Development; Leaf Senescence; Mass Spectrometry; Maturation; Nonhuman; Plant Growth; Plant Leaf; Poaceae; Priority Journal; Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry; Giardia Lamblia Virus; Zea Mays","Acetone; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Crops; Cultivation; Grain (agricultural product); Mass spectrometry; Methanol; Organic compounds; Proton transfer; Volatile organic compounds; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOC; Emission measurement; Environmental conditions; Leaf senescence; Maize; Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometries; PTR-MS; Plants (botany); acetaldehyde; acetic acid; acetone; hexobarbital; methanol; propionaldehyde; terpene; volatile organic compound; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; cereal; developmental stage; environmental conditions; maize; senescence; Article; chlorosis; degeneration; leaf development; leaf senescence; mass spectrometry; maturation; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; Poaceae; priority journal; proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry; Giardia lamblia virus; Zea mays","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1; acetone, 67-64-1; hexobarbital, 1335-39-3, 50-09-9, 56-29-1, 73543-95-0; methanol, 67-56-1; propionaldehyde, 123-38-6","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by FNRS (Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique) for funding the CROSTVOC research project ( T.0086.13 ), in the framework of which this study was carried out.

An on-line quantification and risk assessment method for the organic by-products produced by the NTP removal of toluene from the air has been developed. Formaldehyde, methanol, ketene, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone, acetic acid, benzene, benzaldehyde, and benzoic acid were determined to be the main organic by-products by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), a powerful technique for real-time and on-line measurements of trace levels of VOCs, and a health-related index (HRI) was introduced to assess the health risk of these organic by-products. The discharge power (P) is a key factor affecting the formation of the organic by-products and their HRI values. Higher P leads to a higher removal efficiency (η) and lower HRI. However, higher P also means higher cost and greater production of discharge by-products, such as NO<inf>x</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>, which are also very dangerous to the environment and human health. In practical applications P, HRI, and η must be balanced, and sometimes the risks posed by the organic by-products are even greater than those of the removed compounds. Our mechanistic study reveals that acetone is a crucial intermediate for the removal of toluene by NTP, and we found that toluene molecules first fragment into acetone molecules, followed by other by-products. These observations will guide the study of the mechanism of aromatic molecule dissociation in plasma. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Organic By-products; Ptr-ms; Risk Assessment; Toluene; Acetaldehyde; Acetic Acid; Acetone; Benzaldehyde; Benzene; Benzoic Acid; Formaldehyde; Formic Acid; Methanol; Toluene; Acetaldehyde; Acetone; Air Pollutants; Benzaldehyde; Benzaldehydes; Benzene; Formaldehyde; Plasma Gases; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Acetone; Benzoic Acid; Dielectric Materials; Electric Discharges; Health; Health Risks; Mass Spectrometry; Molecules; Plasma Applications; Proton Transfer; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Human Health Risk Assessment; On-line Quantification; Organic Byproducts; Proton-transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometries; Ptr-ms; Removal Efficiencies; Risk Assessment Methods; Risk Assessment; Acetaldehyde; Acetic Acid; Acetone; Benzaldehyde; Benzene; Benzoic Acid; Formaldehyde; Formic Acid; Ketene Derivative; Methanol; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Benzaldehyde Derivative; Assessment Method; Chemical Compound; Health Risk; Index Method; Mass Spectrometry; Plasma; Pollutant Removal; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Air Pollution Control; Article; Chemical Reaction; Decomposition; Fragmentation Reaction; Health Hazard; Internet; Molecular Weight; Plasma Gas; Quantitative Analysis; Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry; Water Vapor; Air Pollutant; Analysis; Human; Isolation And Purification; Procedures; Acetaldehyde; Air Pollutants; Benzaldehydes; Benzene; Formaldehyde; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Plasma Gases; Risk Assessment; Volatile Organic Compounds","Acetone; Benzoic acid; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Health; Health risks; Mass spectrometry; Molecules; Plasma applications; Proton transfer; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Dielectric barrier discharges; Human health risk assessment; On-line quantification; Organic byproducts; Proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometries; PTR-MS; Removal efficiencies; Risk assessment methods; Risk assessment; acetaldehyde; acetic acid; acetone; benzaldehyde; benzene; benzoic acid; formaldehyde; formic acid; ketene derivative; methanol; toluene; volatile organic compound; benzaldehyde derivative; assessment method; chemical compound; health risk; index method; mass spectrometry; plasma; pollutant removal; public health; risk assessment; air pollution control; Article; chemical reaction; decomposition; fragmentation reaction; health hazard; Internet; molecular weight; plasma gas; quantitative analysis; time of flight mass spectrometry; water vapor; air pollutant; analysis; human; isolation and purification; procedures; Acetaldehyde; Air Pollutants; Benzaldehydes; Benzene; Formaldehyde; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Plasma Gases; Risk Assessment; Volatile Organic Compounds","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1; acetone, 67-64-1; benzaldehyde, 100-52-7; benzene, 71-43-2; benzoic acid, 532-32-1, 582-25-2, 65-85-0, 766-76-7; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; formic acid, 64-18-6, 71-47-6; methanol, 67-56-1; toluene, 108-88-3; Acetaldehyde; Acetone; Air Pollutants; benzaldehyde; Benzaldehydes; Benzene; Formaldehyde; Plasma Gases; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from China Instrumentation Program (No. 2017YFF0106000 ), Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project (No. S30109 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51107137 ).","Abd-Allah, Zaenab, Remediation of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) using non-thermal, atmospheric pressure plasma generated in a packed-bed reactor, Environmental Science and Technology, 48, 1, pp. 558-565, (2014); Bahri, Mitra, Metal organic frameworks for gas-phase VOCs removal in a NTP-catalytic reactor, Chemical Engineering Journal, 320, pp. 308-318, (2017); Añón, J.

As an emerging technology for VOC removal, non-thermal plasma (NTP) with low-energy consumption and high removal efficiency is widely studied. However, in contrary to the abundant experiments, theoretical studies are only few, and the degradation mechanisms and pathways of VOCs are still open questions, which hinders the effective VOC removal. Herein, the density function theory (DFT) calculations of NTP degradations for two typical cyclic organics, cyclohexane and benzene, are performed. The degradations of cyclic organics are mainly resulted by the dehydrogenation, decarburation, elimination, and ring-opening reactions and can be markedly promoted with radical ·OH, H·, and O· produced by background gas (H2O and O2). For cyclohexane degradations, the presence of O· decreases the energy barrier from 81.9 to 8.7 kcal/mol in the initial step, leading to an optimal degradation pathway with minimum plasma energy at around 0.5 eV. For benzene degradations, the presence of ·OH decreases the energy barrier from 118.4 to 5.5 kcal/mol in the initial step, triggering an optimal degradation pathway with minimum plasma energy at around 6 eV. The higher plasma energy required in degradation of benzene is due to its more stable structure than alkanes ring. Moreover, the O<inf>2</inf> concentration and plasma energy are suggested to increase for efficient degradation of cyclohexane and benzene, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzene Degradation; Cyclohexane Degradation; Degradation Pathways; Density Function Theory; Non-thermal Plasma; Voc Removal; Benzene; Cyclohexane; Oxygen; Water; Atmospheric Structure; Benzene; Biodegradation; Cyclohexane; Degradation; Density Functional Theory; Energy Barriers; Energy Efficiency; Energy Utilization; Health Hazards; Organic Compounds; Probability Density Function; Volatile Organic Compounds; Benzene Degradation; Degradation Pathways; Density Function Theory; Nonthermal Plasma; Voc Removal; Plasma Applications; Benzene; Cyclohexane; Oxygen; Volatile Organic Compound; Water; Anthropogenic Source; Degradation; Hazard Assessment; Plasma; Pollutant Removal; Probability Density Function; Theoretical Study; Toxicity; Article; Calculation; Chemical Structure; Concentration (parameters); Dehydrogenation; Elimination Reaction; Isomerization; Plasma Gas; Ring Opening; Structure Analysis","Atmospheric structure; Benzene; Biodegradation; Cyclohexane; Degradation; Density functional theory; Energy barriers; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Health hazards; Organic compounds; Probability density function; Volatile organic compounds; Benzene degradation; Degradation pathways; Density function theory; Nonthermal plasma; VOC removal; Plasma applications; benzene; cyclohexane; oxygen; volatile organic compound; water; anthropogenic source; degradation; hazard assessment; plasma; pollutant removal; probability density function; theoretical study; toxicity; Article; calculation; chemical structure; concentration (parameters); dehydrogenation; elimination reaction; isomerization; plasma gas; ring opening; structure analysis","","benzene, 71-43-2; cyclohexane, 110-82-7; oxygen, 7782-44-7; water, 7732-18-5","Funding Information This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB0601102).","An, Guijie, Degradation of phenol in mists by a non-thermal plasma reactor, Chemosphere, 84, 9, pp. 1296-1300, (2011); Assadi, Aymen Amine, Study of synergetic effect by surface discharge plasma/TiO2 combination for indoor air treatment: Sequential and continuous configurations at pilot scale, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, 310, pp. 148-154, (2015); Añón, J.

In this paper, we propose a volume discharge setup used to purify formaldehyde in air, which is configured by a plate-to-plate dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) channel and excited by an AC high voltage source. The results show that the relative spectral-intensity from DBD cell without formaldehyde is stronger than the case with formaldehyde. The energy efficiency ratios (EERs) of both oxides yield and formaldehyde removal can be regulated by the gas flow velocity in DBD channel, and the most desirable processing effect is the gas flow velocity within the range from 2.50 to 3.33 m s-1. Moreover, the EERs of both the generated dosages of oxides (O<inf>3</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>) and the amount of removed formaldehyde can also be regulated by both of the applied voltage and power density loaded on the DBD cell. Additionally, the EERs of both oxides generation and formaldehyde removal present as a function of normal distribution with increasing the applied power density, and the peak of the function is appeared in the range from 273.5 to 400.0 W l-1. This work clearly demonstrates the regulation characteristic of both the formaldehyde removal and oxides yield by using volume DBD, and it is helpful in the applications of VOCs removal by using discharge plasma. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dielectric Materials; Electric Discharges; Energy Efficiency; Flow Of Gases; Flow Velocity; Formaldehyde; Gas Meters; Nitrogen Oxides; Nitrogen Plasma; Normal Distribution; Plasma Applications; Plasma Theory; Volatile Organic Compounds; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Discharge Plasma; Energy Efficiency Ratio; Formaldehyde Removals; Hydroxyl Radicals; Processing Effects; Spectral Intensity; Volume Discharges; Dielectric Devices","Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Energy efficiency; Flow of gases; Flow velocity; Formaldehyde; Gas meters; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen plasma; Normal distribution; Plasma applications; Plasma theory; Volatile organic compounds; Dielectric barrier discharges; Discharge plasma; Energy efficiency ratio; Formaldehyde removals; Hydroxyl radicals; Processing effects; Spectral intensity; Volume discharges; Dielectric devices","","","This work was partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017B15214), the Research Fund of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education Reform for Chinese Universities (16CCJG01Z004), the Changzhou Science and Technology Program (CJ20160027), National Natural Science Foundation of China (11274092, 61705058) and the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Province (BK20170302).","Añón, J.

The procedure is based on previously developed mathematical models of the corresponding non-stationary bio oxidation processes. Based on the analysis of 27 design versions, real capabilities of biological purification facilities were shown, the effect of design and operation mode parameters on efficiency of the systems of biological destruction of methane, hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde were assessed. In quantitative terms, the results obtained in numerical experiments indicate the necessity of taking into account variation of the rate of pollutant inflow in the process of vessel filling. It was established that an increase in the facility efficiency in terms of the volume of the gas-air mixture, N, causes a decrease in methane concentration at the bioreactor entry and a reduction of the purification degree to 62 %. An increase in the rate of hydrogen sulfide inflow to the reactor leads to a reduction of the purification degree from 98 to 95 %. An increase in the initial concentration of biomass by a factor of 1.7 causes a decrease in concentration of hydrogen sulfide in water from 2.5 to 1.1 g/m3. A significant decrease in the average specific bio oxidative power with an increase in the working space in which the final stage of emission purification from formaldehyde takes place was also observed. The revealed regularities represent a tool for improving quality of design solutions and increasing effectiveness of bio oxidation modes in operation of the systems of biological gas purification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Purification Of Emissions; Bioreactor; Design And Operation Mode Parameters; Purification Efficiency","","","","","Añón, J.

Various sources of VOCs release, especially related to stationary and mobile fuel combustion, are presented. Successive changes in the distribution of fuels toward a utilization of growing amounts of biocomponents are underscored. The impact of different kinds of VOCs emitted to the atmosphere on the environment and human health is discussed within the context of tightening regulations. Main remediation methods developed for the elimination of VOCs are shown with a special emphasis on the catalytic total oxidation. We present advantages of this approach in comparison to the thermal oxidation performed at significantly higher temperatures in the absence of a catalyst. The most important features of catalysts studied in the VOCs combustion, as well as the speculated reaction mechanisms, are elaborated. The catalytic performance and stability of noble metal–containing materials are compared critically to transition metal oxides. Finally, combining adsorption with subsequent catalytic conversion is revealed as a very promising way to abate amounts of emitted VOCs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Pollution; Burning Of Fossil Fuels And Biomass; Catalytic Combustion Of Organic Pollutants; Emission From Mobile And Stationery Sources; Volatile Organic Compounds","","","","This work was supported by the National Science Centre under the grant no. 2013/11/B/ST5/01550.","Chemical Process Technology, (2001); Hazard Mater, (2017); Añón, J.

This research was initiated to optimize the efficient application of the NTP process in benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylene (BTEX) removal. The effects of four variables including temperature, initial BTEX concentration, voltage, and flow rate on the BTEX elimination efficiency were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). The constructed model was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The model goodness-of-fit and statistical significance was assessed using determination coefficients (R2 and R2 <inf>adj</inf>) and the F-test. The results revealed that the R2 proportion was greater than 0.96 for BTEX removal efficiency. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the BTEX removal efficiency was significantly correlated with the temperature, BTEX concentration, voltage, and flow rate. Voltage was the most influential variable affecting the dependent variable as it exerted a significant effect (p < 0.0001) on the response variable. According to the achieved results, NTP can be applied as a progressive, cost-effective, and practical process for treatment of airstreams polluted with BTEX in conditions of low residence time and high concentrations of pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzene; Btex; Ethyl-benzene; Non-thermal Plasma (ntp); Response Surface Methodology (rsm); Toluene; Voc; Xylene; Benzene; Ethylbenzene; Toluene; Xylene; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Benzene Derivatives; Ethylbenzene; Plasma Gases; Toluene; Xylenes; Benzene; Btex; Chemical Compound; Efficiency Measurement; Optimization; Plasma; Response Surface Methodology; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Xylene; Benzene Derivative; Ethylbenzene; Air Pollutant; Analysis; Chemistry; Environmental Protection; Plasma Gas; Procedures; Temperature; Theoretical Model; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Benzene Derivatives; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Models, Theoretical; Plasma Gases; Temperature; Toluene; Xylenes","benzene; BTEX; chemical compound; efficiency measurement; optimization; plasma; response surface methodology; toluene; volatile organic compound; xylene; benzene derivative; ethylbenzene; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental protection; plasma gas; procedures; temperature; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Benzene Derivatives; Conservation of Natural Resources; Models, Theoretical; Plasma Gases; Temperature; Toluene; Xylenes","","benzene, 71-43-2; ethylbenzene, 100-41-4; toluene, 108-88-3; xylene, 1330-20-7; Air Pollutants; Benzene; Benzene Derivatives; ethylbenzene; Plasma Gases; Toluene; Xylenes","Funding information This study (MSc thesis of Mr. Ahmad Hosseinzadeh, grant number: 930617) was funded by Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS).","Añón, J.

For both, catalytic and photocatalytic performances, aerogel monoliths prepared from sol–gel approaches accompanied with an appropriate drying technique, in particular supercritical point drying, have become striking alternative catalysts or catalyst supports compared to the presently used ones prepared from traditional wet synthesis approaches.

Effect of different inlet loadings (0.44–2.68 gm−3h−1), various EBRTs (30, 60 and 90s), bed height, and non-ionic surfactants Tween 80 on biofilter efficiency were evaluated during a long-term period (126 days). The average of removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) were 88% and 0.72 g m−3 h−1 respectively. Over 60% of the total average of RE was related to section 1 of biofilter, where the average of bacterial population (6.74 log CFU/g) and fungi population (4.95 log CFU g−1) was significantly more than in the other sections. Although the effect of surfactant on the removal efficiency was negligible, the removal efficiency of was significantly increased by increase of EBRT and reduction of inlet loading. Dominant species of bacteria in the biofilter bed included Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Proteus spp; fungi species were Aspergillus and Fusarium spp. regarding to the rapid adaptation period (9 days), suitable RE and EC, low pressure drop, and negligible compactness of media, this point is inferable that the biofilter system can be a suitable method to remove UDMH from the polluted airflow. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air; Bagasse; Biofilter; Compost; Scoria; Udmh","","","","This paper is part of a Ph.D. dissertation funded by the Isfahan University of Medical Science (Grant No: 394775 ).

Feasibility was proven by treatment of up to 1000 m3∗h-1 of emissions during sludge centrifugation in a waste water treatment plant under native conditions with ammonia and methane as the main compounds. In subsequent phases styrene, ethanol, n-butanol, 2-butoxyethanol, and gasoline were added as spiking components. Process parameters were pre-defined by a lab-scale plasma/adsorber system using ammonia, n-butanol, and methane as main compounds, and enhanced gas distribution after computational fluid dynamic simulation of the systeḿs geometry. Lab-scale tests without bioprocess at 300 m3∗h-1 showed a reduction of 31%, 44%, and 53% of the VOC content in matter of n-butanol feed, forming butyraldehyde as main intermediate, at specific input energy (SIE) levels of 2.8, 4.2, and 5.6 kWh∗1000 m-3.

VOC removal and odor abatement were further improved to 95% or higher in combination with the subsequent bioprocess.

M., UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia","A diverse range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted from wastewater biosolids processing. Odorous emissions are predominately made up of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) which are typically the only odorants measured. However, a range of VOCs are known to contribute to malodours yet previous studies often overlook the contribution of VOCs in comparison with VSCs. This study aims to evaluate how emissions are affected by different biosolids processing configurations, and if any non-sulfur VOCs should be included in odour measurement and management. Non-sulfur VOCs emitted from biosolids throughout six wastewater treatment plants in the Sydney, Australia region were measured at six locations on average twice each week over 2–3 weeks at each site. Variations in types of VOCs emitted throughout and between the sites were assigned to differences in WWTP processing configurations, plant operation and variations in industrial and municipal flows to the sewer network, referred to as sewer catchments. The presence of VOCs is likely due to biotic generation as well as industrial or residential additions to the sewer network. The dewatered and stored biosolids samples had the highest levels of VOC emissions. Sensorially important odorants were p-cresol and butanoic acid, based on the frequency of detection and odour activity values. Other compounds with a high risk of nuisance impacts were trimethylamine, indole and phenol emitted from the dewatered and stored biosolids, and volatile fatty acids from the anaerobic digester inlet and outlet at one particular site. The findings show that non-sulfur VOCs should be added to odorant monitoring campaigns at WWTPs. Identification of VOCs as sensorially important odorants opens opportunities for the more efficient management of nuisance odours, through targeted odour control or process improvement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nuisance Impact; Odour; Sludge; Wastewater Treatment; Butyric Acid; Indole; Para Cresol; Phenol; Trimethylamine; Biological Materials; Biosolids; Catchments; Dewatering; Fatty Acids; Odor Control; Odors; Organic Compounds; Sewers; Sulfur; Sulfur Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Efficient Managements; Nuisance Impact; Odour Activity Values; Odour Measurements; Process Improvement; Sludge; Volatile Sulfur Compounds; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Volatile Fatty Acids; Butyric Acid; Fatty Acid; Indole; Para Cresol; Phenol; Trimethylamine; Volatile Organic Compound; Biosolid; Odor; Sludge; Sulfur Compound; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Anaerobic Digestion; Article; Australia; Catchment; Concentration (parameters); Odor Control; Sewer; Sludge Dewatering; Waste Water Management; Waste Water Treatment Plant; New South Wales; Sydney [new South Wales]","Biological materials; Biosolids; Catchments; Dewatering; Fatty acids; Odor control; Odors; Organic compounds; Sewers; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Efficient managements; Nuisance impact; Odour activity values; Odour measurements; Process Improvement; Sludge; Volatile sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment plants; Volatile fatty acids; butyric acid; fatty acid; indole; para cresol; phenol; trimethylamine; volatile organic compound; biosolid; odor; sludge; sulfur compound; wastewater treatment plant; anaerobic digestion; Article; Australia; catchment; concentration (parameters); odor control; sewer; sludge dewatering; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]","","butyric acid, 107-92-6, 156-54-7, 461-55-2; indole, 120-72-9; para cresol, 106-44-5; phenol, 108-95-2, 3229-70-7; trimethylamine, 75-50-3","","Añón, J.

We will investigate what pulse parameters result in the highest plasma processing yields. The results show that for ozone generation, secondary-streamer effects appear to have a slight influence on the ozone yield: if the pulse duration increases and/or the voltage increases in such a way that streamers can start to cross the gap in the reactor, the ozone yields decrease. Furthermore, for NO removal, we see a similar effect of pulse duration and applied voltage as for the ozone generation, but the effect of the pulse duration is slightly different: long pulses result in the highest NO-removal yield. However, the NO-removal process is fundamentally different: besides removing NO, the plasma also produces NO and this production is more pronounced in the primary-streamer phase, which is why the pulse polarity has almost no influence on the NO-removal yield (only on the by-product formation). Moreover, the rise time of the pulses has a much more significant effect on ozone generation and NO removal than the pulse duration: a long rise time results in a lower enhanced electric field at the streamer heads, which consequently reduces the production of radicals required for ozone generation and NO removal, and decreases the streamer volume. Consequently, the resulting ozone yields and NO-removal yields are lower. Finally, the main conclusion is that the plasma generated with our nanosecond pulses is very efficient for ozone generation and NO removal, achieving yields as high as 175 g • for ozone generation and 2.5 mol • kWh-1 (or 14.9 eV per NO molecule) for NO removal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Non-thermal Plasma; Plasma Processing; Pulsed Power; Transient Plasma; Electric Fields; Ozone; Plasma Applications; Plasma Devices; Atmospheric Plasmas; By-product Formation; Nonthermal Plasma; Processing Applications; Processing Experiment; Pulsed-power; Secondary Streamers; Transient Plasmas; Plasma Diagnostics","Electric fields; Ozone; Plasma applications; Plasma devices; Atmospheric plasmas; By-product formation; Nonthermal plasma; Processing applications; Processing experiment; Pulsed-power; Secondary streamers; Transient plasmas; Plasma diagnostics","","","This work was supported by the Dutch Technology Foundation STW under contract number 10751.","Añón, J.

However, the MEO process utilizes only one (anodic) compartment toward pollutant degradation. To effectively utilize the full electrochemical cell, an improved electrolytic cell producing both oxidant and reductant mediators at their respective half-cells, which can be employed for treating two pollutants simultaneously, was investigated. The cathodic half-cell was studied first toward maximum [CoI(CN)<inf>5</inf>]4- (Co+) generation (21%) from a [CoII(CN)<inf>6</inf>]3- precursor by optimizing several experimental factors such as the electrolyte, cathode material, and orientation of the Nafion324 membrane.

The practical utility of the newly developed full cell setup, combining the optimized cathodic half-cell and optimized anodic half-cell, was demonstrated by electroscrubbing experiments with simultaneous dichloromethane removal by Co+ via the mediated electroreduction process and phenol removal by Co3+ via the MEO process, showing not only utilization of the full electrochemical cell, but also degradation of two different pollutants by the same applied current that was used in the conventional cell to remove only one pollutant. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by Ministry of Engineering Science and Technology (MEST) from the Korean government (Grant No. 2017R1A2A1A05001484).","Añón, J.

The low-temperature vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) technology is the way that the adsorbates are removed by reducing pressure at low temperature (60~90 ℃) to compensate disadvantages of the existing thermal swing adsorption (TSA) technology. Commercial activated carbon was used and the absorption and desorption characteristics of toluene, a representative VOCs, were tested on a lab scale. Also based on the lab scale experimental results, a 30 m3min-1 VSA system was designed and applied to the actual painting factory to assess the applicability of the VSA system in the field. As a result of lab scale experiments, a 2 mm pellet type activated carbon showed higher toluene adsorption capacity than that of using 4 mm pellet type, and was used in a practical scale VSA system. Optimum conditions for desorption experiments were 80~90 ℃ and 100 torr. In the practical scale system, the adsorption/desorption cycles were repeated 95 times. As a result, VOCs discharged from the painting factory can be effectively removed upto 98% or more even after repeated adsorption/desorption cycles when using VSA technology indicating potential field applicabilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Desorption; Practical Study; Vocs; Vsa Process","","","","","J Korean Soc Environ Eng, (2012); Añón, J.

Effects of this kind of air pollution may include: impairment of the quality of the environment; interference with business activities; discomfort, harm or impairment of the safety of any person; rendering any property, plant or animal unsuitable for human use. Odor treatment technologies can be classified into three categories, namely ones employing chemical (thermal oxidation, catalytic oxidation, ozonation), physical (condensation, adsorption, absorption) and biological (using biofilters, biotrickling filters, bioscrubbers and other bioreactor types) treatment methods. An important advantage of biological treatment methods over physical and chemical technologies is that the biological processes can be conducted at moderate temperatures (10–40 °C) and atmospheric pressure. Moreover, microbial degradation processes are generally oxidative in nature and produce compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, sulfate and nitrate that are ecologically safe. Applications of biological odor treatment date back to 1950ties. Initially, simple biofilters with soil beds have been employed and later, the use of other bed materials in more advanced filter structures has been reported and more sophisticated types of filtration equipment such as biotrickling filters and bioscrubbers have been developed. On the basis of accumulated experience, some more process options and equipment types for the application of biological methods emerged in recent years. During more than 30 years covered by the present review, biological methods of odor treatment have matured to become a well-developed field of process technology. In order to provide an overview of the state of the art, process principles and characteristics including the use of various microorganisms and nutrients, variations in equipment design and application ranges of the different odor treatment technologies are outlined and compared. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofiltration; Biological Odor Treatment; Bioscrubbing; Biotrickling; Emerging Technology; Animals; Atmospheric Pressure; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Biological Water Treatment; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Catalytic Oxidation; Chemical Industry; Degradation; Equipment; Industrial Plants; Industrial Waste Disposal; Industrial Waste Treatment; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Paper And Pulp Mills; Scrubbers; Thermooxidation; Waste Disposal; Waste Treatment; Wastewater Disposal; Wastewater Treatment; Biological Odor Treatment; Biological Treatment Methods; Bioscrubbing; Biotrickling; Chemical Technologies; Emerging Technologies; Microbial Degradation; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Industrial Water Treatment; Odor Control; Oxidation; Paper Mills; Waste Disposal; Water Treatment","Animals; Atmospheric pressure; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Biological water treatment; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalytic oxidation; Chemical industry; Degradation; Equipment; Industrial plants; Industrial waste disposal; Industrial waste treatment; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Paper and pulp mills; Scrubbers; Thermooxidation; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Biological odor treatment; Biological treatment methods; Bioscrubbing; Biotrickling; Chemical technologies; Emerging technologies; Microbial degradation; Wastewater treatment plants; Industrial water treatment; Odor Control; Oxidation; Paper Mills; Waste Disposal; Water Treatment","","","","Abraham, Samantha, Treatment of odor by a seashell biofilter at a wastewater treatment plant, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 65, 10, pp. 1217-1228, (2015); Añón, J.

The acidity played a key role in CO selectivity and carbon deposition; while redox property dominated in the distribution of chlorinated byproducts. Based on the above dicussion, the way to design new catalysts for CVOCs combustion was suggested by tuning the acidity and redox property.

This ecosystem experiences highly complex networks of interactions, but may also present functionally independent entities. Plant roots, a metabolically active hotspot in the soil, take an essential part in below-ground interactions. While plants are known to release an extremely high portion of the fixated carbon to the soil, less information is known about the composition and role of C-containing compounds in the rhizosphere, in particular those involved in chemical communication. Specialized metabolites (or secondary metabolites) produced by plants and their associated microbes have a critical role in various biological activities that modulate the behavior of neighboring organisms. Thus, elucidating the chemical composition and function of specialized metabolites in the rhizosphere is a key element in understanding interactions in this below-ground environment. Here, we review key classes of specialized metabolites that occur as mostly non-volatile compounds in root exudates or are emitted as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The role of these metabolites in below-ground interactions and response to nutrient deficiency, as well as their tissue and cell type-specific biosynthesis and release are discussed in detail. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Allelopathy; Microbiome; Rhizosphere; Root Exudates; Specialized Metabolism; Volatile Organic Compounds; Volatile Organic Compounds; Biochemistry; Biology; Biomolecules; Carbon; Chemical Compounds; Complex Networks; Organic Compounds; Soils; Volatile Organic Compounds; Allelopathy; Chemical Communications; Chemical Compositions; Microbiome; Non-volatile Compounds; Rhizosphere; Root Exudates; Secondary Metabolites; Metabolites; Metabolism; Rhizospheres; Voc; Volatile Organic Compound; Ecosystem; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant; Plant Root; Rhizosphere; Ecosystem; Plant Roots; Plants; Volatile Organic Compounds","Biochemistry; Biology; Biomolecules; Carbon; Chemical compounds; Complex networks; Organic compounds; Soils; Volatile organic compounds; Allelopathy; Chemical communications; Chemical compositions; Microbiome; Non-volatile compounds; Rhizosphere; Root exudates; Secondary metabolites; Metabolites; Metabolism; Rhizospheres; Voc; volatile organic compound; ecosystem; metabolism; microbiology; plant; plant root; rhizosphere; Ecosystem; Plant Roots; Plants; Volatile Organic Compounds","","Volatile Organic Compounds","We are grateful to Uwe Heinig for helpful discussions regarding specialized metabolites.

In addition, biofiltration is known to be less effective when dealing with poorly soluble substances, like some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A non-thermal plasma (NTP) produced with a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) was studied as an option to pre-treat an air stream contaminated by a mixture of VOCs. Therefore, the plasma reactor was operated upstream of a laboratory-scale biofilter. Air admixed with toluene, n-heptane, p-xylene, ethylbenzene and benzene with average concentrations of 95.6, 49.4, 60.8, 47.3 and 36.6 ppm, respectively, was used as a model polluted gas, as these contaminants represent the air stripped by an oil-refinery wastewater treatment plant. Peaks of loading rates at the inlet of the biofilter were simulated by the increase of the flow rates of VOCs. The operation of NTP, with specific energy densities between 92 J L−1 and 256 J L−1 allowed reducing the VOC concentrations down to the level of optimal biofilter operation. In addition, non-water soluble VOCs were converted to more soluble compounds by the plasma treatment. In this first attempt to investigate the synergies between NTP and biofiltration, NTP reveals as a promising option to pre-treat effluents upstream of biofilters for optimized operation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution Control; Biofilter; Btex; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Industrial Wastewater; Loading Rate; Air Pollution Control; Biofiltration; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Effluents; Electric Discharges; Flow Control; Heptane; Industrial Water Treatment; Organic Compounds; Plasma Applications; Pollution Control; River Pollution; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Average Concentration; Btex; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Industrial Wastewaters; Loading Rate; Optimized Operations; Soluble Substances; Specific Energy Density; Biofilters","Air pollution control; Biofiltration; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Effluents; Electric discharges; Flow control; Heptane; Industrial water treatment; Organic compounds; Plasma applications; Pollution control; River pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Average concentration; BTEX; Dielectric barrier discharges; Industrial wastewaters; Loading rate; Optimized operations; Soluble substances; Specific energy density; Biofilters","","","This work was supported by the University of Trento (University Research Project P.STR.14 PLAS) and by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013, grant agreement n°312616).","Brandenburg, Ronny, Plasma-Based Pollutant Degradation in Gas Streams: Status, Examples and Outlook, Contributions to Plasma Physics, 54, 2, pp. 202-214, (2014); Añón, J.

In this research study, a novel nano composite based adsorber was employed as the pre-treatment stage before biofilter to treat the VOC mixture. The hybrid reactor yielded better results compared to the stand alone biofilter. The concentration range employed in this study was 0.5–2.0 g m–3 for n-hexane and 0.25–1.0 g m–3 for styrene. Higher removal efficiencies were achieved at lower inlet concentrations at maximum EBRT of 90 s. Styrene removal efficiencies were found to be better than n-hexane removal efficiencies. The comparison between hybrid model and conventional biofilter proved the superior performance of the hybrid model. The carbon dioxide production was found to be proportional to the degradation rate represented in terms of elimination capacity. The correlation was proposed and actual yield coefficient was found to be lesser than the theoretical value. Biomass growth was studied across the height of the biofilter and found to be appreciable in the lower sections. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofilm; Gas Production; Hybrid Biofilter; N-hexane; Biofilm; Biofiltration; Bioreactor; Composite; Filter; Gas Production; Nanoparticle; Performance Assessment","biofilm; biofiltration; bioreactor; composite; filter; gas production; nanoparticle; performance assessment","","","The authors acknowledge that this research leading to these results has received project funding from The Research Council of Oman under Research Agreement No.: ORG/SU/EBR/12/020.","Añón, J.

The photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) of gas-phase n-decane was studied using a micro-meso-structured-photoreactor irradiated by simulated solar light, consisting of chambers and channels mechanically engraved in an acrylic slab. The network of chambers and channels is sealed with a borosilicate slab, allowing a good light penetration through the entire reactor depth. A sheet of cellulose acetate (CA) coated, in one side, with TiO<inf>2</inf>-P25 was assembled between the two slabs, allowing high spatial illumination homogeneity over the catalyst surface. The P25 thin film was in contact with the air stream flowing in the network. The reactor contains 1.95 g of TiO<inf>2</inf> in contact with the air stream per liter of reactor volume and the illuminated catalyst surface area, in contact with the gas phase, per reactor volume was calculated to be 349 m2 m−3, which is ∼1.4 times higher than that obtained for an annular photoreactor packed with CA monolithic structures coated with TiO<inf>2</inf>-P25. The PCO reaction rate, r<inf>dec</inf>, was assessed under different experimental conditions: amount of TiO<inf>2</inf> supported in CA sheets, n-decane feed concentration, feed flow rate, relative humidity and UV irradiance. The highest r<inf>dec</inf> value (0.82 μmol min−1) was achieved when the following conditions were employed: mTiO<inf>2</inf> = 75 mg, C<inf>dec</inf><inf>feed</inf> = 1.31 × 10−2 mol m−3, Q<inf>feed</inf> = 220 cm3 min−1 and I = 38.4 W m−2.

The electro-generated Cu1+[Ni2+(CN)<inf>4</inf>]1− applied to the removal of gaseous TCE by electro-scrubbing showed almost 100% removal with a gas flow rate of up to 4 L min−1, which is high enough for use on an industrial scale. In addition, cyclic voltammetry confirmed that TCE removal occurs through MER at a high reaction rate. Both gas and solution phase analyses revealed only CO<inf>2</inf> as the final product, confirming that mineralization is possible by MER. The achievement of 823.8 mg/day removal of TCE under the given conditions brings the present heterometallic approach in electro-scrubbing to a new level in air-pollutant removal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Divided Electrolytic Cell; Electro-scrubbing; Gaseous Tce; Heterogeneous Metallic Complex; Homogeneous Cu2+[ni2+(cn)4]; Mer; Air Pollution; Air Pollution Control; Anesthetics; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysts; Cyclic Voltammetry; Flow Of Gases; Metallic Compounds; Nickel; Pollution; Reduction; Trichloroethylene; Electro-scrubbing; Electrocatalytic Reduction; Electrochemical Formation; Gaseous Tce; Gaseous Trichloroethylenes; Homogeneous Cu[ni(cn)]; Metallic Complexes; Oxidation/reduction Potentials; Copper Compounds","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Anesthetics; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cyclic voltammetry; Flow of gases; Metallic compounds; Nickel; Pollution; Reduction; Trichloroethylene; Electro-scrubbing; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electrochemical formation; Gaseous TCE; Gaseous trichloroethylenes; Homogeneous Cu[Ni(CN)]; Metallic complexes; Oxidation/reduction potentials; Copper compounds","","","This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) under the Ministry of Engineering Science and Technology (MEST) from the South Korean Government (Grant No. 2014R1A2A1A01001974 ).","Añón, J.

Often organic materials which may have limited beneficial use in their raw state or have regulatory disposal constraints can be transformed by composting into marketable products. The limits on beneficial reuse may be regulations or they may be due to the potential for materials to be putrescible or pathogenic. Composting can be a solution for each of these. The implementation of composting on a large scale (in contrast to home or backyard composting) involves materials handling. Technological implementation of composting must be consistent with the biological demand of the system. If the biological system is violated, conditions will not be optimized for composting, and problems such as odor generation, insufficient aeration or moisture, or a combination of these conditions may result. Past problems and closure of facilities have been largely due to violations of the biological systems. Product quality with respect to particle size, inclusions, moisture content and other physical aspects are a function of engineering design. A well designed system must have the biological and engineering principles in harmony at all times. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Apparatus for Working Garbage and Refuse of Towns, (1922); Sludge Composting and Utilization Statewide Applicability for New Jersey, (1980); Composting of Municipal Solid Wastes in the United States, (1971); Personal Visit, (1976); Añón, J.

Firstly, we employ a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method to coat a thin layer of copper on the surface of QCM silver electrode. Then, a novel metal complex as sensing material, [Cu(DDS)<inf>2</inf>(Cl)<inf>2</inf>(MeOH)<inf>2</inf>], is grown in-situ on the copper layer to ensure a strong coupling between metal complex sensing materials and QCM electrode. The sensing material is characterized through following instruments: elemental analysis, single crystal XRD, SEM, PXRD, IR spectra and TGA. The sensing test results indicate that the QCM sensor exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity toward gaseous formaldehyde because of a reversible interaction between amino group and HCHO molecule. The detection limit reaches down to 50 ppb. This implies the facile-fabricated sensor has a great potential in the area of rapid, stable, sensitive, and selective formaldehyde on-site detection. Based on the temperature-varying micro-gravimetric experiment, enthalpy change is quantitatively obtained, which indicates that the interaction between the complex and HCHO molecules belongs to chemical adsorption. The values of ΔH calculated by Gaussian 09 indicate that chemical adsorption between –NH<inf>2</inf> group and aldehyde group play a leading role in detecting selectively formaldehyde gas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Formaldehyde Sensor; Gaussian Calculation; In-situ Growth; Quartz Crystal Microbalances (qcm); [cu(dds)2(cl)2(meoh)2]; Chemical Bonds; Chemical Sensors; Chlorine Compounds; Copper; Copper Compounds; Deposition; Electrodes; Formaldehyde; Gas Detectors; Metal Complexes; Molecules; Physical Vapor Deposition; Single Crystals; Formaldehyde Detection; Formaldehyde Sensor; Gaseous Formaldehyde; Gaussians; In-situ Growth; Innovative Strategies; Reversible Interactions; [cu(dds)(cl)(meoh)]; Quartz Crystal Microbalances","Chemical bonds; Chemical sensors; Chlorine compounds; Copper; Copper compounds; Deposition; Electrodes; Formaldehyde; Gas detectors; Metal complexes; Molecules; Physical vapor deposition; Single crystals; Formaldehyde detection; Formaldehyde sensor; Gaseous formaldehyde; Gaussians; In-situ growth; Innovative strategies; Reversible interactions; [Cu(DDS)(Cl)(MeOH)]; Quartz crystal microbalances","","","","Añón, J.

Removal and energy efficiencies have been determined as a function of the residence time of the contaminated air within the reactor, the kind of packed-bed material (ferroelectrics or classical dielectric materials), the frequency and the incorporation of a ferroelectric plate onto the active electrode together with the inter-electrode ferroelectric pellets filling the gap. Results at low frequency with the small reactor and the ferroelectric plate showed an enhancement in energy efficiency (e.g., it was multiplied by a factor of six and three for toluene and chloroform, respectively) and in removal yield (e.g., it increased from 22% to 52% for chloroform and from 15% to 21% for methane). Such enhancements have been attributed to the higher energy of plasma electrons and a lower reactor capacitance found for this plate-modified configuration. A careful analysis of reaction efficiencies and electron energy distributions for the different investigated conditions and the simulation of the electric field at the necks between ferroelectric/dielectric pellets complete the present study. Overall, the obtained results prove the critical role of the barrier architecture and operating conditions for an enhanced performance of pollution removal processes using DBD systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Ferroelectric Materials; Packed-bed Plasma Reactor; Plasma Decontamination; Pollutant Removal; Voc's Removal; Acetone; Chlorine Compounds; Dielectric Devices; Electric Discharges; Electrodes; Electron Energy Levels; Energy Efficiency; Ferroelectricity; Flow Control; Methane; Packed Beds; Pelletizing; Plasma Applications; Pollution; Residence Time Distribution; Storm Sewers; Toluene; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Reactors; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Electron Energy Distributions; Ferroelectric Component; Ferroelectric Pellets; Packed-bed Plasma Reactors; Pollutant Removal; Pollutant Removal Efficiency; Ferroelectric Materials","Acetone; Chlorine compounds; Dielectric devices; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Electron energy levels; Energy efficiency; Ferroelectricity; Flow control; Methane; Packed beds; Pelletizing; Plasma applications; Pollution; Residence time distribution; Storm sewers; Toluene; Dielectric barrier discharge reactors; Dielectric barrier discharges; Electron energy distributions; Ferroelectric component; Ferroelectric pellets; Packed-bed plasma reactors; Pollutant removal; Pollutant removal efficiency; Ferroelectric materials","","","","Añón, J.

The VOC metabolic profile of an organism has been referred to as its ‘volatilome’ (or ‘volatome’) and the study of volatilome/volatome is characterized as ‘volatilomics’, a relatively new category in the ‘omics’ arena. There is considerable literature on VOCs extracted destructively from microalgae for applications such as food, natural products chemistry, and biofuels. VOC emissions from living (in vivo) microalgae too are being increasingly appreciated as potential real-time indicators of the organism’s state of health (SoH) along with their contributions to the environment and ecology. This review summarizes VOC emissions from in vivo microalgae; tools and techniques for the collection, storage, transport, detection, and pattern analysis of VOC emissions; linking certain VOCs to biosynthetic/metabolic pathways; and the role of VOCs in microalgae growth, infochemical activities, predator-prey interactions, and general SoH. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","In Vivo Emission; Microalgae; Voc; Volatile Metabolites; Volatile Organic Compound; Volatilome; Volatilomics; Volatome; 2 Methylisoborneol; Beta Ionone; Chloroform; Cyanogen Bromide; Dimethyl Disulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Geosmin; Hydrogen Sulfide; Isoprene; Methanethiol; Methyl Bromide; Methyl Iodide; 2 Methylisoborneol; 3 Hexen 1 Ol; Beta Cyclocitral; Beta Ionone; Chloroform; Cyanogen Bromide; Diisopropyl Disulfide; Diisopropyl Trisulfide; Dimethyl Disulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Dimethyl Trisulfide; Geosmin; Hydrogen Sulfide; Isoprene; Isopropyl Thiol; Methanethiol; Methyl Bromide; Methyl Iodide; Molecular Iodine; Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid; Terpenoid; Unclassified Drug; Volatile Organic Compound; Algal Growth; Asymptomatic Disease; Axenic Culture; Biosynthesis; Cell Communication; Chemical Structure; Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii; Cyanobacterium; Diagnostic Procedure; Human; Lipid Oxidation; Mass Fragmentography; Metabolism; Metabolite; Metabolomics; Microalga; Nonhuman; Photobioreactor; Predator Prey Interaction; Review; Senescence","2 methylisoborneol; 3 hexen 1 ol; beta cyclocitral; beta ionone; chloroform; cyanogen bromide; diisopropyl disulfide; diisopropyl trisulfide; dimethyl disulfide; dimethyl sulfide; dimethyl trisulfide; geosmin; hydrogen sulfide; isoprene; isopropyl thiol; methanethiol; methyl bromide; methyl iodide; molecular iodine; polyunsaturated fatty acid; terpenoid; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; algal growth; asymptomatic disease; axenic culture; biosynthesis; cell communication; chemical structure; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; cyanobacterium; diagnostic procedure; human; lipid oxidation; mass fragmentography; metabolism; metabolite; metabolomics; microalga; nonhuman; photobioreactor; predator prey interaction; Review; senescence","","2 methylisoborneol, 2371-42-8; beta ionone, 14901-07-6; chloroform, 67-66-3; cyanogen bromide, 506-68-3; dimethyl disulfide, 624-92-0; dimethyl sulfide, 75-18-3; geosmin, 19700-21-1; hydrogen sulfide, 15035-72-0, 7783-06-4; isoprene, 78-79-5; methanethiol, 74-93-1; methyl bromide, 74-83-9; methyl iodide, 74-88-4","Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA-0003525.

Toluene was selected as the test VOC molecule, and the VSA regeneration experiments results were compared to the thermal swing adsorption process. Cyclic adsorption-desorption experiments were performed using a lab-scale apparatus with commercial activated carbon (Samchully Co.). The VSA regeneration was performed in air (0.5 L/min) at 363.15 K and 13,332 Pa. The comparative results depicted that in terms of VSA regeneration, it was found that after the fifth regeneration, about a 90% regeneration ratio was maintained. These experiments thus confirm that the VSA regeneration process has good recovery while operating at low temperatures (363.15 K) and 13,332 Pa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activated Carbon; Cyclic Adsorption-desorption Experiments; Recovery; Regeneration; Vacuum Swing Adsorption; Volatile Organic Compounds; Activated Carbon; Adsorption; Desorption; Gas Chromatography; Organic Compounds; Recovery; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption Capacities; Adsorption Desorption; Commercial Activated Carbons; Regeneration; Regeneration Process; Thermal Swing Adsorption; Treatment Methods; Vacuum Swing Adsorptions; Organic Carbon","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Desorption; Gas chromatography; Organic compounds; Recovery; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption desorption; Commercial activated carbons; Regeneration; Regeneration process; Thermal swing adsorption; Treatment methods; Vacuum swing adsorptions; Organic carbon","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of this work by Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) (Project: 2014000110013).","Añón, J.

For this purpose, malodorous species were generated by exposing freshly cooked foods emitting odorants with levels moderately above their respective threshold values in a confined room. The deodorization efficiency of the four AF systems was then tested for a period of 30 min by estimating the extent of reduction in odorant levels after the operation of each AF. The removal efficiency of the four AF units against each odorant was evaluated as follows: (1) between AF products from different manufacturers, (2) between odorants and ultrafine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>), and (3) between operation and natural degassing. The average sorptive removal of odorants was generally < 80% and considered less effective or non-effective relative to PM<inf>2.5</inf>. Further examination of odor reduction, if evaluated in terms of odor indices like odor intensity (OI) and odor activity value (OAV), recorded a mean of 33% and 87%, respectively.

Despite of several well developed AOPs, the majority of them are effective only at acidic or neutral pH, namely Fenton related processes, making the list of available effective advanced oxidation technologies strongly limited. In many cases, industrial effluents are formed at basic pH conditions. This paper reviews the state of the art of AOPs exclusively at alkaline pH, the type of compounds and effluents effectively degraded, the influence of pH on the efficiency of the processes, economic evaluation and degradation pathways. Spent caustic, polyester and acetate fiber dye effluents, phenol, acidic and sulfur based compounds, specific dyes and drugs were effectively degraded at basic pH. Factors like point of zero charge, pKa of the compounds, amount of radicals produced and activation of the oxidants are crucial factors that affect the treatment efficiency of AOPs at basic pH. H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> were the cheapest processes while peroxone was the most expensive. The treatment costs were in general too expensive and unrealistic using the methodology used in the literature. The alternative methodology proposed in this paper reduced the treatment costs by three orders of magnitude to values more realistic and economical feasible. Literature regarding treatment of real effluents using AOPs at basic pH is scarce and further research is needed to perform complete analysis. It is important to present some alternatives regarding the treatment of alkaline effluents without pH correction using such technologies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aop; Basic Ph; Catalyst; Ozone; Persulfate; Wastewater; Alkalinity; Catalysts; Costs; Efficiency; Effluents; Oxidation; Ozone; Ph; Sewage; Sulfur Compounds; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment; Advanced Oxidation Process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Advanced Oxidation Technology; Basic Ph; Biodegradable Compounds; Industrial Wastewaters; Persulfate; Three Orders Of Magnitude; Industrial Water Treatment","Alkalinity; Catalysts; Costs; Efficiency; Effluents; Oxidation; Ozone; pH; Sewage; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Advanced oxidation process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Advanced oxidation technology; Basic pH; Biodegradable compounds; Industrial wastewaters; Persulfate; Three orders of magnitude; Industrial water treatment","","","","Añón, J.

However, these methods have problems such as a high pressure drop, short lifespan, large site, economics and formation of secondary pollutants. Recently, advanced oxidation processes have been studied to overcome these problems. Electron beam (EB) technology is one of the most promising advanced technologies due to its special characteristics. In the present paper, we introduce the research and application of EB technology to treat volatile organic and odorous compounds. The removal efficiency of these compounds by EB processing is discussed regarding diverse conditions, such as differences in initial concentrations, background gases, absorbed doses, and relative humidity. Furthermore, the characteristics and performance of new EB hybrid technologies designed to solve the problems that occur with EB-only systems are reviewed. Finally, the limitations and potential of EB technology for air pollution treatment are also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Absorbed Dose; Advanced Oxidation Process (aop); Electron Beam (eb); Hybrid System; Odor; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Air Pollution; Air Pollution Control; Electron Beams; Hybrid Systems; Odor Removal; Odors; Oxidation Resistance; Pollution; Radiation Chemistry; Volatile Organic Compounds; Absorbed Dose; Advanced Oxidation Process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Electron-beam Technologies; Initial Concentration; Removal Efficiencies; Research And Application; Various Technologies; Problem Solving","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Electron beams; Hybrid systems; Odor removal; Odors; Oxidation resistance; Pollution; Radiation chemistry; Volatile organic compounds; Absorbed dose; Advanced oxidation process; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Electron-beam technologies; Initial concentration; Removal efficiencies; Research and application; Various technologies; Problem solving","","","The author would like to thank Clarian H. and Lee H.J. for their insightful contributions.

Fenton as an AOP has been widely used in wastewater treatment. However, the dosing method of Fenton reagents is not suitable for the treatment of continuous-flow VOCs waste-gas since H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, a major reagent in the Fenton reaction, will be rapidly eliminated. In this study, the Fenton process was used to enhance benzene degradation in an aeration container with intermittent dosing of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. With the same total dosage of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, the benzene removal efficiency reached 85% by intermittent dosing while it was quickly decreased to 0% by dosing in a lump. The generated CO<inf>2</inf> by intermittent dosing of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> is nearly 3 times that in the latter. In addition, no by-product was generated in the gas phase. The possible pathways and mechanism of benzene degradation by the Fenton process were proposed according to the detected intermediates in the solution.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the key precursors of O<inf>3</inf> and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (an important component of PM<inf>2.5</inf>), have a critical influence on atmospheric chemistry and subsequently affect regional and global climate. Thus, VOCs have been extensively studied in many cities and regions in China, especially in the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions where photochemical smog pollution has become increasingly worse over recent decades.

Sixteen dominant VOCs, with total concentrations ranging from 1.6 × 103 to 6.7 × 103 μg m−3, were presented during the manual process of dismantling television printed circuit boards using electric heating furnaces. An integrated treatment technique, involving a spray tower (ST), electrostatic precipitation (EP), and photocatalysis (PC), was used to eliminate these VOCs. The highest VOC removal efficiency during the 60-day treatment period was 69.5%. The removal efficiency was mainly due to the combined effect of preferential elimination of hydrosoluble VOCs and efficient interception of large-sized particles by ST; the enhanced capture efficiency of micro-sized particles by EP; and the dominant degradation of particle-free VOCs by PC. The PC treatment was able to remove more hydrocarbons (an average 62.7%) than nitrogen- and oxygen-containing and aromatic compounds (36.4% and 27.3% in average), due to the hydrocarbons’ higher dielectric constants. Risk assessment revealed that the non-cancer and cancer risks associated with VOCs significantly decreased after the integrated technique was applied, indicating that the treatment is an efficient approach for purifying the atmosphere and protecting human health inside e-waste recycling workshops. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","E-waste Recycling; Integrated Spray Tower-electrostatic Precipitation-photocatalysis Technique; Risk Attenuation; Vocs Degradation; Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Diseases; Efficiency; Electrostatic Separators; Electrostatics; Health Risks; Photocatalysis; Printed Circuit Boards; Recycling; Risk Assessment; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Treatment; Wastes; Decontamination Techniques; E-waste Recycling; Electrostatic Precipitation; Integrated Techniques; Micro-sized Particles; Removal Efficiencies; Resource Management; Treatment Techniques; Electronic Waste","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Diseases; Efficiency; Electrostatic separators; Electrostatics; Health risks; Photocatalysis; Printed circuit boards; Recycling; Risk assessment; Volatile organic compounds; Waste treatment; Wastes; Decontamination techniques; E-waste recycling; Electrostatic precipitation; Integrated techniques; Micro-sized particles; Removal efficiencies; Resource management; Treatment techniques; Electronic Waste","","","This is contribution No. IS–2219 from GIGCAS.

A trickle bed air biofilter (TBAB) operated under acidic pH 4 is subjected to aerobic biodegradation of chloroform and ethanol. The TBAB is composed of pelleted diatomaceous earth filter media inoculated with filamentous fungi species, which served as the principle biodegrading microorganism. The removal efficiencies of 5 ppm<inf>v</inf> of chloroform mixed with different ratios of ethanol as cometabolite (25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ppm<inf>v</inf>) ranged between 69.9 and 80.9%. The removal efficiency, reaction rate kinetics, and the elimination capacity increased proportionately with an increase in the cometabolite concentration. The carbon recovery from the TBAB amounted to 69.6% of the total carbon input. It is postulated that the remaining carbon contributed to excess biomass yield within the system. Biomass control strategies such as starvation and stagnation were employed at different phases of the experiment. The chloroform removal kinetics provided a maximum reaction rate constant of 0.0018 s−1. The highest ratio of chemical oxygen demand (COD)<inf>removal</inf>/nitrogen<inf>utilization</inf> was observed at 14.5. This study provides significant evidence that the biodegradation of a highly chlorinated methane can be favored by cometabolism in a fungi-based TBAB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofiltration; Chloroform; Cometabolism; Ethanol; Filamentous Fungi; Trickle Bed Air Biofilter; Alcohol; Carbon; Chlorine; Chloroform; Methane; Nitrogen; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biological Filter Beds; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Chlorine Compounds; Efficiency; Ethanol; Fungi; Pelletizing; Rate Constants; Reaction Kinetics; Reaction Rates; Removal; Aerobic Biodegradation; Chemical Oxygen Demand Removals; Co Metabolisms; Co-metabolic Degradation; Filamentous Fungi; Maximum Reaction Rate; Removal Efficiencies; Trickle Bed Air Biofilters; Biofilters; Alcohol; Carbon; Chlorine; Chloroform; Methane; Nitrogen; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Ethanol; Fungus; Metabolism; Article; Biofilter; Biomass; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Chemical Reaction Kinetics; Concentration (parameters); Controlled Study; Nonhuman; Ph; Trickle Bed Air Biofilter","Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biological filter beds; Chemical oxygen demand; Chlorine compounds; Efficiency; Ethanol; Fungi; Pelletizing; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Reaction rates; Removal; Aerobic biodegradation; Chemical oxygen demand removals; Co metabolisms; Co-metabolic degradation; Filamentous fungi; Maximum reaction rate; Removal efficiencies; Trickle bed air biofilters; Biofilters; alcohol; carbon; chlorine; chloroform; methane; nitrogen; biodegradation; biofiltration; ethanol; fungus; metabolism; Article; biofilter; biomass; chemical oxygen demand; chemical reaction kinetics; concentration (parameters); controlled study; nonhuman; pH; trickle bed air biofilter","","alcohol, 64-17-5; carbon, 7440-44-0; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; chloroform, 67-66-3; methane, 74-82-8; nitrogen, 7727-37-9","","undefined; undefined; Añón, J.

The future development of clean technologies for the treatment of wastewater loaded with heavy metals entails environment friendly and sustainable processes that may allow simultaneously the recovery of the metals and their reutilization as value-added catalysts to be used in environmental applications. This is the first review regarding the biorecovery of metals and their further reutilization as heterogeneous catalysts. In this regard, metallic residues that generally would be considered as a waste at the end of the treatment process can be reutilized and transformed into value-added catalysts to be used in environmental applications. This review is focused in two broad areas: the biorecovery of chromium by a combined biosorption system consisting of bacteria supported on zeolites and the catalytic reutilization of the metal-loaded zeolites in the oxidation of organic compounds, in both gaseous and liquid phase. After an overview describing the main subjects in the field of heavy metals recovery, biosorption, zeolites, and catalytic oxidation, in the following sections special emphasis will be given to the main results and findings regarding these clean technologies of biorecovery and reuse of metals in catalytic reactions of environmental concern. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biosorption; Catalytic Reutilization; Chromium; Heterogeneous Catalysis; Oxidation Reactions; Zeolites; Chromium; Cyclohexanol; Biosorption; Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic Oxidation; Chromium; Environmental Technology; Heavy Metals; Metal Recovery; Metals; Oxidation; Waste Treatment; Wastewater Treatment; Zeolites; Environmental Applications; Environmental Catalysis; Environmental Concerns; Heterogeneous Catalyst; Metal-loaded Zeolites; Oxidation Reactions; Re-utilization; Wastewater Pollution; Chemicals Removal (water Treatment); Chromium; Cyclohexanol; Cyclohexene Derivative; Metal; Metal Complex; Metal Ion; Organic Compound; Zeolite; Catalysis; Catalyst; Heavy Metal; Oxidation; Wastewater Treatment; Water Pollution; Arthrobacter; Arthrobacter Viscosus; Bacterium; Biosorption; Ecotoxicity; Environmental Impact; Gas; Liquid; Metal Recovery; Nonhuman; Oxidation Reduction State; Physical Chemistry; Review; Waste Water Management","Biosorption; Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chromium; Environmental technology; Heavy metals; Metal recovery; Metals; Oxidation; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Zeolites; Environmental applications; Environmental catalysis; Environmental concerns; Heterogeneous catalyst; Metal-loaded zeolites; Oxidation reactions; Re-utilization; Wastewater pollution; Chemicals removal (water treatment); chromium; cyclohexanol; cyclohexene derivative; metal; metal complex; metal ion; organic compound; zeolite; catalysis; catalyst; heavy metal; oxidation; wastewater treatment; water pollution; Arthrobacter; Arthrobacter viscosus; bacterium; biosorption; ecotoxicity; environmental impact; gas; liquid; metal recovery; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; physical chemistry; Review; waste water management","","chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; cyclohexanol, 108-93-0","","Añón, J.

A factor was developed in terms of μg of by-product produced per mg of EXT removed per sq-meter surface area of catalyst for estimating the mass of by-products produced. The by-products quantified were: acetone, hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, crotonaldehyde, toulene, 1,4-benzoquinone, benzaldehyde, phenol, benzylalcohol, cresol, hydroquinone and benzoic acid. The by-products accounted for 2.3-4.2% of the total mass of EXT treated.For treating concentrations of 220 μg/m3 (ethylbenzene), 260 μg/m3 (p,m-xylene), 260 μg/m3 (o-xylene) and 320 μg/m3 (toluene), at a flow rate of 7 L/min for 12 h in a laboratory of volume 195 m3, the estimated cancer risks of by-products to the occupants were 1.51 × 10-6, 1.06 × 10-6, 4.69 × 10-7, and 1.58 × 10-9 respectively. The overall hazard index (HI) of the by-products for EXT was of the order 10-4; which is much less than desired level of 1.0. The estimated risks were within the acceptable level.

Experimental results are fitted to a second-order polynomial model. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the adjusted model is highly significant, with a satisfactory goodness of fit. ANOVA results also indicate that among the significant variables, modified zeolite samples by ion exchange using Fe or Cu increase the adsorption capacity toward Cl-VOC.

This article involves the development of a laboratory-scale apparatus to characterize gas-phase dioxin adsorption on zeolites and thermal desorption. The laboratory-scale apparatus prepared stable levels of dioxin in a nitrogen flow and in-line adsorption/thermal desorption coupled to a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer. The apparatus takes into account the low-volatility of the dioxins for their transport in the carrier gas and the possible high temperatures used for zeolite desorption. The apparatus functionalities, such as in-line concentration measurement by a sampling loop and gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer and breakthrough measurement during in-line adsorption, were validated. The generator delivers a stable 2,3-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin concentration of 304 ± 6 µg/m3 over 20 days. Two methods, weighing a vial and mass analysis of the sampling loop, were employed for measuring the concentration provided results that were in good agreement. Preliminary gas-phase adsorption experiments have been carried out without any memoryw effects in the valves and transfer lines. The dioxin concentration generated and large diameter of the beads led to low adsorption efficiency of dioxin on FAU13X Na-type zeolites due to a low micropore accessibility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dioxins; In-line Adsorption; In-line Gas Chromatography–mass Spectrometry; Specific Adsorption By Zeolite; Thermal Desorption; Adsorption; Gas Chromatography; Mass Spectrometers; Mass Spectrometry; Organic Pollutants; Thermal Desorption; Zeolites; Adsorption Efficiency; Concentration Measurement; Dioxins; Emission Monitoring; Gas Phase Adsorption; Selective Adsorbents; Specific Adsorption; Stationary Sources; Gases","Adsorption; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Organic pollutants; Thermal desorption; Zeolites; Adsorption efficiency; Concentration Measurement; Dioxins; Emission monitoring; Gas phase adsorption; Selective adsorbents; Specific adsorption; Stationary sources; Gases","","","","Añón, J.

The main sources of VOCs are petroleum refineries, fuel combustions, chemical industries, decomposition in the biosphere and biomass, pharmaceutical plants, automobile industries, textile manufacturers, solvents processes, cleaning products, printing presses, insulating materials, office supplies, printers etc. The most common VOCs are halogenated compounds, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, aromatic compounds, and ethers. High concentrations of these VOCs can cause irritations, nausea, dizziness, and headaches. Some VOCs are also carcinogenic for both humans and animals. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the emission of VOCs. Among the available technologies, the catalytic oxidation of VOCs is the most popular because of its versatility of handling a range of organic emissions under mild operating conditions. Due to that fact, there are numerous research initiatives focused on developing advanced technologies for the catalytic destruction of VOCs. This review discusses recent developments in catalytic systems for the destruction of VOCs.

Although a large number of Hg0 removal technologies already have been developed, none of them can obtain large-scale applications due to various technical and economic issues. Therefore, more efforts are needed to develop cost-effective Hg0 removal technologies. Advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) are defined as those technologies that can generate mainly the hydroxyl radical ([Formula presented]) with high oxidation potential and other reactive oxygen species including superoxide anion radical (O<inf>2</inf>[Formula presented]−), hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) and singlet oxygen, by various environmentally benign physical or chemical processes. In the past two decades, AOTs have gained an extensive attention research and successful applications in water treatment and soil remediation, as well as in flue gas purification for multipollutant treatment. In recent years, an increasing attention has been paid to the removal of Hg0 in flue gas using AOTs due to the excellent prospects of this technology. To date, the four main AOTs for removing Hg0 in flue gas include plasma AOTs, TiO<inf>2</inf> photocatalytic AOTs, photochemical AOTs and activated oxidant AOTs. While these AOTs have shown excellent prospects for removing Hg0 in flue gas, a number of technical issues need to be resolved before they are amenable to industrial applications. This article provides the first comprehensive review of the progress and recent developments of these four AOTs for removing Hg0 in flue gas, with emphasis on the chemistry and processes involved. The effects of the main flue gas components and process parameters on Hg0 removal using these AOTs are summarized. The reaction products, mechanism, kinetics, reactor types and process flow systems, and impacts on of Hg0 removal are also comprehensively reviewed, with insights into the challenges for large-scale applications. This review is intended to advance our understanding and outline directions for future developments of this research field. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activated Oxidant; Advanced Oxidation Technologies (aots); Hg0 Removal; Photochemical; Plasma; Tio2 Photocatalytic; Air Purification; Cost Effectiveness; Flue Gases; Flues; Gases; Health Hazards; Oxidants; Oxidation; Oxygen; Plasmas; Reaction Kinetics; Soil Conservation; Soil Pollution; Titanium Dioxide; Water Treatment; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Advanced Oxidation Technology; Environmentally Benign; Large-scale Applications; Photo-catalytic; Photochemical; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Anion Radicals; Mercury (metal)","Air purification; Cost effectiveness; Flue gases; Flues; Gases; Health hazards; Oxidants; Oxidation; Oxygen; Plasmas; Reaction kinetics; Soil conservation; Soil pollution; Titanium dioxide; Water treatment; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Advanced oxidation technology; Environmentally benign; Large-scale applications; Photo-catalytic; Photochemical; Reactive oxygen species; Superoxide anion radicals; Mercury (metal)","","","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51576094 , 51206067 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Special Project and General Project (Nos. 2015T80516 , 2013M531281 ), and Training Project of Jiangsu University Youth Backbone Teacher.

Here, a dielectric barrier discharge NTP was used to evaluate the treatment efficiency of several common VOCs at constant experimental conditions (gas residence time of 0.016 s in the plasma zone, 95-100 ppm<inf>v</inf> average inlet VOC concentration in air). When treated as single pollutant with a specific input energy (SIE) of 350 J L-1, the removal efficiency of the VOC followed the following sequence: methyl ethyl ketone (50%), benzene (58%), toluene (74%), 3-pentanone (76%), methyl tert-butyl ether (80%), ethylbenzene (81%), and n-hexane (90%). The effects of pollutant structure on VOC removal efficiency were investigated. The highest removal efficiencies were observed for compounds with the highest percentage of hydrogen in their molecular structures. During treatment of toluene and ethylbenzene vapors, a dark brown, tar-like deposit formed inside the plasma reactor. The deposit formation rate depended on both treated VOCs as well as on experimental conditions such as VOC concentration, and SIE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution Control; Deposits; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Non-thermal Plasma; Vocs Removal; Air Pollution Control; Deposits; Dielectric Devices; Dielectric Materials; Electric Discharges; Ethylbenzene; Flow Control; Hexane; Ketones; Pollution; Pollution Control; Removal; River Pollution; Thermal Pollution; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Dielectric Barrier Discharges; Emerging Technologies; Experimental Conditions; Methyl Tert Butyl Ether; Non-thermal Plasma Reactors; Nonthermal Plasma; Specific Input Energies; Vocs Removal; Plasma Applications","Air pollution control; Deposits; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Electric discharges; Ethylbenzene; Flow control; Hexane; Ketones; Pollution; Pollution control; Removal; River pollution; Thermal pollution; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Dielectric barrier discharges; Emerging technologies; Experimental conditions; Methyl tert butyl ether; Non-thermal plasma reactors; Nonthermal plasma; Specific input energies; VOCs removal; Plasma applications","","","","Añón, J.

Different preparation methods have been followed leading to mesoporous materials with different characteristics. Whilst a mesoporous catalyst formed by aggregation of nanocrystals has been produced by soft chemistry using oxalic acid as precipitating agent, a mesoporous material with crystalline walls have been prepared by a nanocasting route using a hard template. These catalysts have been characterized by several physicochemical techniques: XRD, N<inf>2</inf> adsorption, TPR, XPS, TEM, HR-TEM, SAED and EDX. Among the different α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts synthesized differences not only in the surface area and morphology have been observed but also in the lattice parameter, in the concentration of oxygen defects for VOCs adsorption and in the reducibility. In the case of the toluene oxidation it has been observed that the catalytic activity is highest for the catalysts prepared by a nanocasting route, which presents a very high surface area of 208 m2 g-1. Conversely, for propane oxidation the most active catalyst resulted to be the mesoporous nanocrystalline catalyst formed by aggregation. In this case, a direct relationship between reducibility and catalytic activity normalized per surface area has been observed. The differences between toluene and propane oxidation can be tentatively ascribed to different reaction mechanisms to be accounted for. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Total Oxidation; Mesoporous Α-fe2o3; Nanocasting; Propane; Toluene; Catalyst Activity; Catalysts; Catalytic Oxidation; Lanthanum Compounds; Nanocrystals; Oxalic Acid; Oxidation; Propane; Surface Defects; Toluene; Mesoporous; Mesoporous Catalysts; Nanocasting; Nanocrystalline Catalysts; Physicochemical Techniques; Precipitating Agents; Soft Chemistry Routes; Total Oxidation; Mesoporous Materials","Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Lanthanum compounds; Nanocrystals; Oxalic acid; Oxidation; Propane; Surface defects; Toluene; Mesoporous; Mesoporous catalysts; Nanocasting; Nanocrystalline catalysts; Physicochemical techniques; Precipitating agents; Soft chemistry routes; Total oxidation; Mesoporous materials","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the DGICYT in Spain ( CTQ2012-37925-C03-1 , CTQ2012-37925-C03-2 , CTQ2012-37925-C03-3 and CTQ2012-37984-C02-01 ) and FEDER for financial support.

Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV)-based processes are an emerging and promising technology for environmental remediation such as air cleaning, wastewater treatment, and air/water disinfection. When VUV irradiation, photolysis, photocatalysis, and ozone-assisted oxidation are involved at the same time, it results in the fast degradation of air pollutants because of their strong oxidizing capacity. The mechanisms of how the oxidants are produced and how they react are discussed in this review. This paper focuses mainly on the three VUV-based oxidation processes including VUV photolysis, VUV combined with ozone-assisted oxidation, and VUV-PCO with emphasis on their mechanisms and applications.

Effect of various factors on growth and toluene degradation by newly isolated T. asperellum was studied in batch studies, and the optimum conditions were found to be pH 7.0, temperature 30 °C, and initial toluene concentration 1.5 (v/v)%. Continuous removal of gaseous toluene was monitored in upflow packed bed reactor (UFPBR) using T. asperellum. Effect of various parameters like column height, flow rate, and the inlet toluene concentration were studied to evaluate the performance of the biofilter. The maximum elimination capacity (257 g m−3 h−1) was obtained with the packing height of 100 cm with the empty bed residence time of 5 min.

This review addresses the mechanistic aspects of catalyst activation by NTP, such as the generation and fixation of reactive species, facilitation of redox cycles, photocatalysis, and local heating, to clarify the combined effects of plasma and catalysis. The plasma-catalytic removal of VOCs preferentially requires the catalyst to have a large specific surface area, high surface oxygen storage capacity, and to be highly reducible. The energy consumption and deactivation of catalysts are considered by comparing continuous and cyclic operations in terms of specific input energy, VOC removal and energy efficiencies, and byproduct formation. Based on the information in the literature, a plasma-catalytic system operating in cyclic adsorption-oxidation mode is recommended for the treatment of air contaminated by dilute VOCs. Finally, the effects of NTP on the regeneration of deactivated catalysts are also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst; Cyclic Treatment; Mechanisms; Nonthermal Plasma; Plasma-catalysis; Vocs","","","","","Añón, J.

However, biodegradation is very sensitive to variations of inlet concentrations and flow rate that usually occurs in real industrial processes; furthermore, an acclimation period is required by microorganisms to adapt to new conditions of flow rate and concentration. A possible solution to overcome these issues is represented by a pre-Treatment with non-Thermal plasma (NTP). The synergy between an NTP reactor and a biofilter in removing a mixture of VOCs from air is the object of this paper. A mixture of five VOCs (benzene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, n-heptane and toluene) and humid air was chosen to represent the gaseous effluent stripped from an industrial wastewater treatment plant. A sudden increase in the VOC concentrations was intentionally induced to understand if NTP can manage peaks of the inlet concentration of pollutants and help the biodegradation carried out in the biofilter. NTP revealed to be capable of both pre-Treating concentrations peaks and converting the initial VOCs in more soluble compounds; in conclusion, NTP is able to help biodegradation, allows controlling unsteady conditions and prevents stress to bacteria. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution Control; Biofilter; Catalysis; Industrial Wastewater; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Pollution; Benzene Refining; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Catalysis; Effluent Treatment; Effluents; Heptane; Industrial Water Treatment; Mixtures; Organic Compounds; Pollution; Pollution Control; Pollution Induced Corrosion; River Pollution; Thermal Pollution; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Water Treatment Plants; Acclimation Period; Biological Technology; Industrial Processs; Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plants; Industrial Wastewaters; Inlet Concentration; Low Concentrations; Unsteady Conditions; Air Pollution Control; Atmospheric Pollution; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Bioremediation; Catalysis; Concentration (composition); Industrial Waste; Pollutant Removal; Pollution Control; Volatile Organic Compound; Wastewater; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Bacteria (microorganisms)","Air pollution; Benzene refining; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Catalysis; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Heptane; Industrial water treatment; Mixtures; Organic compounds; Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; River pollution; Thermal pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Acclimation period; Biological technology; Industrial processs; Industrial wastewater treatment plants; Industrial wastewaters; Inlet concentration; Low concentrations; Unsteady conditions; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; biodegradation; biofiltration; bioremediation; catalysis; concentration (composition); industrial waste; pollutant removal; pollution control; volatile organic compound; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant; Bacteria (microorganisms)","","","","Dictionary of Ecology and Environmental Science, (1993); Official Journal of the European Communities L; Off J Eur Union, (2025); Preis, Sergei V., Potential of electric discharge plasma methods in abatement of volatile organic compounds originating from the food industry, Journal of Environmental Management, 114, pp. 125-138, (2013); Añón, J.

Therefore, to abate VOCs emission, the catalytic oxidation process has been extensively studied in laboratories and widely applied in various industries. This report is mainly focused on the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) with additional discussion about chlorinated VOCs. This review covers the recent developments in catalytic combustion of VOCs over noble metal catalysts, nonnoble metal catalysts, perovskite catalysts, spinel catalysts, and dual functional adsorbent-catalysts. In addition, the effects of supports, coke formation, and water effects have also been discussed. To develop efficient and cost-effective catalysts for VOCs removal, further research in catalytic oxidation might need to be carried out to strengthen the understanding of catalytic mechanisms involved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Off J Eur Union, (2025); Climate Change 2001 the Scientific Basis, (2001); Añón, J.

By comparing the working gases of air and Ar, the results indicate that n-b/air/Ar system exhibits slightly better performance than n-b/air system in APPJ and CAPPJ, suggesting that energetic primary electrons from Ar discharge would sufficiently retain the plasma reactive species for facilitating the decomposition of n-butanol.

In our research, two types of plasma catalytic system, including continuously introduced and adsorption-discharge plasma system, were studied. The results showed that the loaded metals retained the highly ordered mesopore structure of SBA-15. The activities of as-prepared catalysts for the toluene conversion and carbon balance in both catalytic systems decreased in the following order: AgMn/SBA-15>Ag/SBA-15>Mn/SBA-15>SBA-15, which were consistent with the ozone decomposition activities. Compared to traditional continuously introduced plasma system, the adsorption-discharge plasma system slightly increased toluene conversion and significantly improved the carbon balance. The reaction intermediates and products in two plasma systems were detected by the GC-MS and in situ FT-IR analyses. The results showed that the types of organic byproducts detected in the adsorption-discharge system greatly decreased compared to continuously introduced system. Moreover, the different mechanisms of two systems were discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Adsorption-discharge; Catalysis; Non-thermal Plasma; Toluene; Adsorption; Byproducts; Catalysis; Catalyst Activity; Catalysts; Manganese; Plasma Devices; Plasma Theory; Reaction Intermediates; Silver; Temperature Programmed Desorption; Toluene; X Ray Diffraction; Adsorption Desorption Isotherms; Different Mechanisms; Impregnation Methods; Mesopore Structures; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Decomposition; Temperature-programmed Reduction; Toluene Conversion; Electric Discharges","Adsorption; Byproducts; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Manganese; Plasma devices; Plasma theory; Reaction intermediates; Silver; Temperature programmed desorption; Toluene; X ray diffraction; Adsorption desorption isotherms; Different mechanisms; Impregnation methods; Mesopore structures; Nonthermal plasma; Ozone decomposition; Temperature-programmed reduction; Toluene conversion; Electric discharges","","","This work is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.

The general ethanol response (ΔV<inf>MAX</inf>) of all mAu/nPt/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensors was smaller than that of the 0.2Au/0.8Pd/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor, which showed the largest ΔV<inf>MAX</inf> among mAu/nPd/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensors in our previous study. In the series of mPt/nPd/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensors, on the other hand, the 0.8Pt/0.2Pd/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor showed larger ΔV<inf>MAX</inf> to ethanol than that of the 0.2Au/0.8Pd/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor. Moreover, the ΔV<inf>MAX</inf> of the Pt/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor to ethanol was slightly larger than of the 0.8Pt/0.2Pd/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor. The co-loading of 10 wt% MO with 1.0 wt% Pt nanoparticles onto the mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> was effective in improving the ΔV<inf>MAX</inf> to ethanol of the Pt/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor in some cases, and the 1.0Pt/10CeO<inf>2</inf>/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensor showed the largest ΔV<inf>MAX</inf> to ethanol among all the 1.0Pt/10MO/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensors tested.

On the other hand, integral processing of the sensor-signal profiles showed that the magnitude of the approximately integrated dynamic response (IDR), which was largely dependent on the amount of VOCs adsorbed on the mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, may provide an indication of the quantitative VOC detection. Furthermore, the control of the amount of CeO<inf>2</inf> loaded and the value of low temperature at pulse-driven heating enabled the 1.0Pt/lCeO<inf>2</inf>/mp-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> sensors to detect a small amount of VOCs in comparison with general catalytic combustion-type gas sensors, because of the large IDR to the VOCs at a low-concentration range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption/combustion-type Gas Sensor; Alumina; Ceo2; Platinum; Voc; Acetone; Adsorption; Alumina; Aluminum; Catalysis; Chemical Sensors; Chemicals Removal (water Treatment); Ethanol; Gas Detectors; Gold; Manganese; Nanoparticles; Palladium; Platinum; Powder Metals; Powders; Precious Metals; Signal Detection; Solutions; Synthesis (chemical); Temperature; Volatile Organic Compounds; Catalytic Combustion; Ceo; Differential Sensors; Low Concentrations; Microwave Assisted; Selective Detection; Solvothermal Treatment; Sonochemical Reduction; Metal Nanoparticles","Acetone; Adsorption; Alumina; Aluminum; Catalysis; Chemical sensors; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Ethanol; Gas detectors; Gold; Manganese; Nanoparticles; Palladium; Platinum; Powder metals; Powders; Precious metals; Signal detection; Solutions; Synthesis (chemical); Temperature; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic combustion; CeO; Differential sensors; Low concentrations; Microwave assisted; Selective detection; Solvothermal treatment; Sonochemical reduction; Metal nanoparticles","","","","Añón, J.

The catalytic activity of RM was influenced by an acid treatment and the calcination temperature. Acid-treated RM (HRM) catalysts with a platinum loading (Pt/HRM) were prepared using a conventional impregnation method. Platinum catalysts supported on γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (Pt/Al) were prepared for comparison. The physicochemical properties of the RM, HRM and Pt/HRM catalysts were characterized by BET analysis, ICP-AES, H<inf>2</inf>-TPD, XRD, FTIR, SEM, and FE-TEM. The acid treatment increased the BET surface area of the RM significantly, resulting in an increase in catalytic activity. Increasing the calcination temperature from 400°C to 600°C caused a decrease in its catalytic activity. Increasing the platinum loading on HRM(400) from 0.1wt.% to 1wt.% led to an increase in the toluene conversion, which was attributed to the better redox properties. The catalytic activities of the Pt/HRM(400) catalysts were superior to those of the Pt/Al catalysts. Benzene, toluene, o-xylene, and hexane were oxidized completely over the 1wt.% Pt/HRM(400) catalyst at reaction temperatures less than 280°C. The presence of water vapor in the feed had a negative effect on the activity of the 1wt.% Pt/HRM(400) catalyst. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complete Oxidation; Lattice Oxygen; Platinum; Red Mud; Volatile Organic Compounds; Benzene; Hexane; Ortho Xylene; Platinum; Toluene; Atomic Emission Spectroscopy; Calcination; Catalysts; Gas Chromatography; Organic Compounds; Oxidation; Platinum; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Calcination Temperature; Complete Oxidation; Impregnation Methods; Lattice Oxygen; Physicochemical Property; Platinum Catalysts; Reaction Temperature; Red Mud; Catalyst Activity; Benzene; Hexane; Ortho Xylene; Platinum; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Acidification; Catalysis; Catalyst; Oxidation; Performance Assessment; Physicochemical Property; Sludge; Temperature Effect; Waste Treatment; Water Vapor; Xylene; Article; Atomic Emission Spectrometry; Brunauer Emmett Teller Isotherm; Infrared Spectrophotometry; Isotherm; Low Temperature; Oxygen Transport; Physical Chemistry; Reaction Time; Red Mud; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Steady State; Surface Area; Thermal Conductivity; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Water Content; X Ray Diffraction","Atomic emission spectroscopy; Calcination; Catalysts; Gas chromatography; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Platinum; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Calcination temperature; Complete oxidation; Impregnation methods; Lattice oxygen; Physicochemical property; Platinum catalysts; Reaction temperature; Red mud; Catalyst activity; benzene; hexane; ortho xylene; platinum; toluene; volatile organic compound; acidification; catalysis; catalyst; oxidation; performance assessment; physicochemical property; sludge; temperature effect; waste treatment; water vapor; xylene; Article; atomic emission spectrometry; Brunauer Emmett Teller isotherm; infrared spectrophotometry; isotherm; low temperature; oxygen transport; physical chemistry; reaction time; red mud; scanning electron microscopy; steady state; surface area; thermal conductivity; transmission electron microscopy; water content; X ray diffraction","","benzene, 71-43-2; hexane, 110-54-3; ortho xylene, 95-47-6; platinum, 7440-06-4; toluene, 108-88-3","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2013R1A1A2057577).","Añón, J.

Adsorption of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) with AC is a highly exothermic reaction that potentially causes fires in AC beds. Moreover, 2,3-butanediol (BDO) is produced in the desorbed solvent, causing yellowing and odor of the recovered solvent. This study applied a continuous adsorption–desorption apparatus for evaluating the operating capacities and BDO concentration in recovered MEK containing modified and original ACs. AC-1 (TAKETA- G2X) was used as the target for modification. The experimental results indicate that using MgO as the modifier increases the ignition point by 12°C and that applying KNO<inf>3</inf> as the modifier reduces the AC ignition point by 28°C (compared with AC-1). The BDO concentration of the desorbed MEK solvent can be reduced by increasing the loading of the modifying agent (Ethanolamine) (Im-1: 3.1 wt%; Im-5: 6.2 wt%). Moreover, applying the AC pretreated with nitrogen (Im-6) as adsorbent significantly reduces the BDO concentration (from 0.123 wt% to 0.073 wt%). Because desorption and purging procedures were performed in N<inf>2</inf> atmospheres, the BDO concentrations of the desorbed MEK solvents were relatively low and ranged from 0.032 wt% to 0.043 wt%. When the MEK concentration was reduced to 2000 ppm, lower BDO concentrations (0.012–0.022 wt%) were measured in the recovered MEK solvent. The way to modify activated carbon and a better desorbing sequence to effectively inhibit the oxidation of MEK to BDO are developed. The results obtained indicate that the BDO concentration in the desorbed solvent was lower than the original MEK solvent (0.023 wt%). Different approaches can be applied simultaneously to achieve high inhibition effects; however, carbon adsorption performance may be negatively affected. Implications: The study is motivated to improve the quality of recovered solvent and reduce fire hazards, particularly when AC is applied for adsorbing a ketone-based solvent (e.g., MEK). The experimental results indicate that the BDO concentration in the recovered solvent can be reduced and the ignition point of AC can be increased by modifying the AC with an appropriate agent. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2 Butanone; 2,3 Butanediol; Activated Carbon; Ethanolamine; Ethylenediamine; Nitrogen; Ozone; Toluene; Butanediol; Charcoal; 2,3-butylene Glycol; Butanones; Butylene Glycols; Charcoal; Methylethyl Ketone; Solvents; Activated Carbon; Adsorption; Desorption; Fire Hazards; Ketones; Magnesia; Potash; Potassium Nitrate; Recovery; Volatile Organic Compounds; Carbon Adsorption; Desorption Characteristics; Inhibition Effect; Methyl Ethyl Ketones; Modified Activated Carbons; Modifying Agents; Operating Capacity; Recovered Solvent; Solvents; 2 Butanone; 2,3 Butanediol; Activated Carbon; Carbonyl Derivative; Coal; Ethanolamine; Ethylenediamine; Functional Group; Nitrogen; Ozone; Toluene; 2,3-butylene Glycol; Alkanone; Butanediol; Charcoal; Methylethyl Ketone; Solvent; Adsorption; Alcohol Production; Article; Ash; Atmosphere; Chemical Modification; Compressed Air; Desorption; Molecular Weight; Oxidation; Priority Journal; Surface Area; Surface Property; Temperature Sensitivity; Chemistry; Procedures; Sewage; Butanones; Butylene Glycols; Charcoal; Waste Disposal, Fluid","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Desorption; Fire hazards; Ketones; Magnesia; Potash; Potassium Nitrate; Recovery; Volatile organic compounds; Carbon adsorption; Desorption characteristics; Inhibition effect; Methyl ethyl ketones; Modified activated carbons; Modifying agents; Operating capacity; Recovered solvent; Solvents; 2 butanone; 2,3 butanediol; activated carbon; carbonyl derivative; coal; ethanolamine; ethylenediamine; functional group; nitrogen; ozone; toluene; 2,3-butylene glycol; alkanone; butanediol; charcoal; methylethyl ketone; solvent; adsorption; alcohol production; Article; ash; atmosphere; chemical modification; compressed air; desorption; molecular weight; oxidation; priority journal; surface area; surface property; temperature sensitivity; chemistry; procedures; sewage; Butanones; Butylene Glycols; Charcoal; Waste Disposal, Fluid","","2 butanone, 78-93-3; 2,3 butanediol, 513-85-9; activated carbon, 64365-11-3, 82228-96-4; ethanolamine, 141-43-5; ethylenediamine, 107-15-3; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; ozone, 10028-15-6; toluene, 108-88-3; butanediol, 25265-75-2; charcoal, 16291-96-6; 2,3-butylene glycol; Butanones; Butylene Glycols; Charcoal; methylethyl ketone; Solvents","","American Society Testing and Materials ASTM D2866 83 Method Total Ash Content of Activated Carbon; Añón, J.

Current progress in the experimental observations and the understanding of interactions between NTP and catalyst are reviewed herein. Considering the diffusion length and lifetime of reactive species, we introduced a dimensionless parameter Λ that describes the criteria for a direct interaction between NTP and catalysts. Several lines of experimental evidences on the interaction were introduced: discharge mode, formation of metal cluster ions, and plasma-induced fluorescence from the catalyst. For faujasite zeolites, the Si/Al ratio was found to be an important parameter that determines the propagation of surface streamers and catalytic performance. The oxidation status of metals is closely correlated with the Si/Al ratio, which is related to substantial changes in electrical resistivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalyst, Voc Removal, Zeolite; Nonthermal Plasma; Catalysis; Catalysts; Discharge (fluid Mechanics); Pollution Control; Silicon; Temperature; Catalytic Performance; Catalytic Reactions; Dimensionless Parameters; Direct Interactions; Experimental Evidence; Multi-disciplinary Approach; Nonthermal Plasma; Voc Removal; Electric Discharges","Catalysis; Catalysts; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Pollution control; Silicon; Temperature; Catalytic performance; Catalytic reactions; Dimensionless parameters; Direct interactions; Experimental evidence; Multi-disciplinary approach; Nonthermal plasma; VOC removal; Electric discharges","","","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support given by the Grant-in-aid for Scientific Research(C) (26400539).","Air Waste, (1993); Añón, J.

The long term test proved that chosen catalyst and technological layout can lower operating costs and still meet emission limits for VOC and CO. The estimated payback period of given investment was under 5 years. The stress test showed that unit can be partially overloaded (gas flows exceeding design value). In technological conditions tests, impact of the different gas flow and oxygen concentration levels on conversions of VOC and CO was observed. Such tests can help find out the optimal operating conditions for both pilot plant and full scale plant. It was discovered, that impact of the different oxygen concentration levels and gas flows in quite different for the conversions of VOC and CO.

A dielectric barrier discharge was applied to two mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and air. Ethanol and ethyl acetate (Mixture 1) and benzene, toluene and octane (Mixture 2), in addition to being typical constituents of the waste air released by MBTs of waste, also represent real emissions from two specific sectors that use biofiltration for air pollution control (APC): the printing (Mixture 1) and the petrochemical industries (Mixture 2). At the highest specific energy densities applied to the discharge (900-2520 J L-1), all the initial VOCs were removed by 95-100%. With respect to ethyl acetate, the maximal CO<inf>2</inf> selectivity and the maximal energy yield resulted in 62-70% and 6-11 g kW-1 h-1, respectively; with regards to benzene, the same parameters resulted in 52-90% and 0.17-0.72 g kW-1 h-1, respectively. At medium-low energy, acetaldehyde and acetic acid were detected as the main byproducts of Mixture 1, while several trace compounds were found as the byproducts of Mixture 2. Interestingly, the byproducts generated are more polar than the initial compounds and, thus, their solubility in water is higher.

The Pd2+ ions of the dispersed palladium on the amorphous surface of AlPO<inf>4</inf> are in D4h symmetry. They can partially be reduced into Pd0 even in dynamic conditions by a mixture of butan-2-ol and oxygen. TPD/TPSR showed that the active sites are formed by the couple PdO/Pd. The presence of PdO on the surface favours the production of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). The CO<inf>2</inf> formation was never observed below 100 °C. Moreover, desorption of the MEK takes place in two waves arising from two different types of sites. Only the reactivity of the first set of sites which are located around 80 °C was considered in the present study. As a matter of fact, the oxidation of butan-2-ol into MEK (<1.3%) at 74.2 °C describes a counter-clockwise hysteresis attributed to a bistability induced by the competition between the redox processes that the surface and the reagents undergo. This sensibility of the catalyst to the parameters governing the reaction resulted in an oscillating oxidation of butan-2-ol. Spontaneous oscillations of the MEK production (α<inf>one</inf>) appear around 85 °C and stop before 100 °C. Oscillations of the temperature of the catalyst bed were also recorded but their amplitude never exceeds 7 °C. An oscillatory regime appears also for butan-2-ol pressures ranging from 0.61 to 1.65 kPa and for a total flow rate between 80 and 260 mL min-1. The oscillating oxidation of butan-2-ol is accompanied by a significant enhancement of the methyl ethyl ketone production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Butan-2-ol Oxidation; Hysteresis Loop; Oscillating Oxidation; Pd(x)/alpo4; Tpd/tpsr; Catalysts; Hysteresis; Hysteresis Loops; Ketones; Oxidation; Palladium; Palladium Compounds; Surface Reactions; Temperature Programmed Desorption; Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy; Amorphous Surfaces; Dynamic Condition; Methyl Ethyl Ketones; Oscillatory Regimes; Spontaneous Oscillations; Surface Reactivity; Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction; Uv-vis Spectroscopy; Aluminum Compounds","Catalysts; Hysteresis; Hysteresis loops; Ketones; Oxidation; Palladium; Palladium compounds; Surface reactions; Temperature programmed desorption; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Amorphous surfaces; Dynamic condition; Methyl ethyl ketones; Oscillatory regimes; Spontaneous oscillations; Surface reactivity; Temperature programmed surface reaction; UV-vis spectroscopy; Aluminum compounds","","","The authors wish to sincerely thank the Hassan II Academy of Sciences and Technology and the CNRST for the appreciated financial support kindly provided to our research program.","Alvarez-Galvan, M.

The nanomaterials, being comprised of Au, Pd and Au-Pd nanoparticles and possessing high surface areas were applied as versatile and efficient catalysts in benzene, toluene and o-xylene (BTX) oxidation and in the steam reforming of ethanol for hydrogen production. The results revealed that the catalytic behavior in both processes was influenced by the experimental conditions and the nature of the catalyst employed. The Au-Pd/MCM-41 catalyst was the most active in the BTX total oxidation. On the basis of characterization data, it was proposed that the close contact between Pd and Au and the higher dispersion of Pd may be responsible for the enhanced activity of the bimetallic catalyst. However, the strong interaction between the noble metals did not improve the performance of the bimetallic catalyst in ethanol steam reforming, the Pd/MCM-41 catalyst being the most active and selective for hydrogen production. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Btx Oxidation; Gold; Gold-palladium; Palladium; Steam Reforming Of Ethanol; Catalyst Activity; Catalysts; Ethanol; Gold; Gold Alloys; Hydrogen Production; Mesoporous Materials; Oxidation; Precious Metals; Steam Reforming; Transmission Electron Microscopy; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; X Ray Scattering; Bimetallic Catalysts; Efficient Catalysts; Environmental Process; Ethanol Steam Reforming; Experimental Conditions; Steam Reforming Of Ethanol; Strong Interaction; Temperature-programmed Reduction; Palladium","Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Ethanol; Gold; Gold alloys; Hydrogen production; Mesoporous materials; Oxidation; Precious metals; Steam reforming; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray scattering; Bimetallic catalysts; Efficient catalysts; Environmental process; Ethanol steam reforming; Experimental conditions; Steam reforming of ethanol; Strong interaction; Temperature-programmed reduction; Palladium","","","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by CNPq and FAPEMIG .","Añón, J.

Surface modification with H<inf>2</inf>S was observed to enhance the adsorption of toluene and promote the degradation rate at the start of photocatalytic degradation, while that with NH<inf>3</inf> inhibited the adsorption of toluene but enhanced the photocatalytic activity for the toluene degradation. By a combination of in situ DRIFTS and other characterization methods, the adsorption mechanism and relationship between surface structure and photocatalytic activity were proposed. For TiO<inf>2</inf>-H<inf>2</inf>S, the sulfhydryl group, which is formed from the dissociation of H<inf>2</inf>S molecules, could easily interact with toluene. The low photocatalytic activity may be caused by the inhibition of the regeneration of surface hydroxyl groups, poor generation of O<inf>2</inf>- radicals and accumulation of highly stable intermediates. For TiO<inf>2</inf>-NH<inf>3</inf>, steric hindrance serves as interference to the adsorption of toluene, while the abundant surface hydroxyl groups are possibly conducive to the degradation of toluene. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","In Situ Drifts; Photocatalysis; Surface Modification; Tio2; Toluene; Adsorption; Biodegradation; Degradation; Photocatalysis; Surface Treatment; Titanium Dioxide; Adsorption Mechanism; Characterization Methods; Photo Catalytic Degradation; Photocatalytic Activities; Situ Drift; Surface Hydroxyl Groups; Tio; Toluene Degradations; Toluene","Adsorption; Biodegradation; Degradation; Photocatalysis; Surface treatment; Titanium dioxide; Adsorption mechanism; Characterization methods; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalytic activities; Situ DRIFT; Surface hydroxyl groups; TiO; Toluene degradations; Toluene","","","This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2012CB922004), National Nature Science Foundation of China (11205159, 11179034), and Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (1308085MB27, 1408085MB25).

Heterogeneous TiO<inf>2</inf>-based semiconductors are a promising technology for achieving this goal. Anatase/brookite/rutile tricrystalline TiO<inf>2</inf> with mesoporous structure was synthesized by a low-temperature hydrothermal route in the presence of HNO<inf>3</inf>. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and N<inf>2</inf> adsorption-desorption isotherm. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by photocatalytic decomposition of toluene in air under UV light illumination. The results show that tricrystalline TiO<inf>2</inf> exhibited higher photocatalytic activity and durability toward gaseous toluene than bicrystalline TiO<inf>2</inf>, due to the synergistic effects of high surface area, uniform mesoporous structure and junctions among mixed phases. The tricrystalline TiO<inf>2</inf> prepared at R<inf>HNO3</inf>=0.8, containing 80.7% anatase, 15.6% brookite and 3.7% rutile, exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, about 3.85-fold higher than that of P25. The high activity did not significantly degrade even after five reuse cycles. In conclusion, it is expected that our study regarding gas-phase degradation of toluene over tricrystalline TiO<inf>2</inf> will enrich the chemistry of the TiO<inf>2</inf>-based materials as photocatalysts for environmental remediation and stimulate further research interest on this intriguing topic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gaseous; Mesoporous; Nanomaterials; Photocatalysis; Tricrystalline Tio2; Voc; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Air Pollutants; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Complexation; Durability; Indoor Air Pollution; Magnetic Semiconductors; Mesoporous Materials; Nanostructured Materials; Oxide Minerals; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Temperature; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; X Ray Diffraction; Environmental Remediation; Gaseous; Low Temperature Hydrothermal Routes; Mesoporous; Photocatalytic Activities; Photocatalytic Decomposition; Tricrystalline Tio2; Uniform Mesoporous Structure; Titanium Dioxide; Catalysis; Decomposition; Indoor Air; Photochemistry; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Pollutant; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Analysis; Chemistry; Crystallization; Ecosystem Restoration; Indoor Air Pollution; Isolation And Purification; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Radiation Response; Ultraviolet Radiation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Catalysis; Crystallization; Environmental Restoration And Remediation; Oxidation-reduction; Photochemical Processes; Titanium; Ultraviolet Rays; Volatile Organic Compounds","Complexation; Durability; Indoor air pollution; Magnetic semiconductors; Mesoporous materials; Nanostructured materials; Oxide minerals; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Temperature; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; X ray diffraction; Environmental remediation; Gaseous; Low temperature hydrothermal routes; Mesoporous; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic decomposition; Tricrystalline TiO2; Uniform mesoporous structure; Titanium dioxide; catalysis; decomposition; indoor air; photochemistry; toluene; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; titanium; titanium dioxide; analysis; chemistry; crystallization; ecosystem restoration; indoor air pollution; isolation and purification; oxidation reduction reaction; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Catalysis; Crystallization; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Oxidation-Reduction; Photochemical Processes; Titanium; Ultraviolet Rays; Volatile Organic Compounds","","titanium, 7440-32-6; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; toluene, 108-88-3; Air Pollutants; Titanium; titanium dioxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds","This work was supported by grants from the National High Technology Research and Development Program (863) of China (Nos. 2010AA064902 and 2012AA062702 ) and the Key Innovation Team for Science and Technology of Zhejiang Province (No. 2009R50047 ).","Añón, J.

In this study, up to 71 odorous VOCs were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at the manure treatment plant. These compounds can be classified into five different categories, including alkanes, olefins, aromatics, volatile organosulphur compounds and terpenes. Toluene, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl sulphide, xylene and ethylbenzene were the five most abundant pollutants. A pilot-scale biotrickling filter (BTF) was employed to treat the complex odorous gases. Correlation analysis showed that the removal efficiency (RE) of the BTF was related with the molecular weight and chemical structure of contaminants.

The positive impact of the use of a multiphase bioreactor is that the organic phase constitutes a pollutant reservoir and also helps to overcome possible pollutant toxicity. In addition and to overcome the drawbacks of the use of a solid organic phase (high pressure drop and low mass transfer) instead of a liquid organic phase, the considered solid phase was the aqueous. Consequently, silicone oil (polydimethylsiloxane) which showed its relevance for implementation in multiphase bioreactors was used. Promising results were observed from the analysis of toluene in the gaseous phase; for an initial amount of 2 g L-1 related to the organic phase, a v/v ratio of 0.5 of the organic phase to the aqueous agar phase, total toluene consumption was observed in about 9 days, leading to a global biodegradation rate of approximately 3.1 mg L-1 h-1, namely in the range of values previously observed in liquid/liquid systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activated Sludge; Immobilized Culture; Silicone Oil; Toluene; Two-phase Partitioning Bioreactor; Dimeticone; Toluene; Air Pollutants; Sewage; Silicone Oils; Toluene; Algae; Biodegradation; Bioreactors; Liquids; Mass Transfer; Petroleum Reservoir Engineering; Polysaccharides; Silicones; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Activated Sludge; Biodegradation Rate; Immobilized Culture; Liquid/liquid Systems; Nonaqueous Phase Liquids; Silicone Oil; Toluene Biodegradation; Two Phase Partitioning Bioreactor; Organic Pollutants; Dimeticone; Silicone Oil; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Pollutant; Sewage; Activated Sludge; Agar; Biodegradation; Bioreactor; Immobilization; Nonaqueous Phase Liquid; Polymer; Reservoir; Toxicity; Agar Medium; Article; Hydrophobicity; Phase Partitioning; Solid; Water Pollutant; Water Pollution; Bioremediation; Chemistry; Ecosystem Restoration; Isolation And Purification; Microbiology; Phase Transition; Procedures; Air Pollutants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Restoration And Remediation; Phase Transition; Sewage; Silicone Oils","Algae; Biodegradation; Bioreactors; Liquids; Mass transfer; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Polysaccharides; Silicones; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Activated sludge; Biodegradation rate; Immobilized culture; Liquid/liquid systems; Nonaqueous phase liquids; Silicone oil; Toluene biodegradation; Two phase partitioning bioreactor; Organic pollutants; dimeticone; silicone oil; toluene; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; sewage; activated sludge; agar; biodegradation; bioreactor; immobilization; nonaqueous phase liquid; polymer; reservoir; toxicity; agar medium; Article; hydrophobicity; phase partitioning; solid; water pollutant; water pollution; bioremediation; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; isolation and purification; microbiology; phase transition; procedures; Air Pollutants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Phase Transition; Sewage; Silicone Oils","","dimeticone, 32028-95-8, 68248-27-1, 9004-73-3, 9006-65-9; toluene, 108-88-3; Air Pollutants; Sewage; Silicone Oils; Toluene","","Analyse Et Traitement Physicochimique Des Rejets Atmospheriques Industriels, (1998); Añón, J.

In this paper, the aim was to identify the role of key process parameters and biodegradability of the degradation products using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, which provided the fundamental data to evaluate the possibilities of the combined system. Effects of various technologic parameters like initial concentration of mixtures, residence time and relative humidity on the decomposition and the degradation products were examined and discussed. It was found that the removal efficiency of mixed VOCs decreased with increasing initial concentration. The removal efficiency reached the maximum value as relative humidity was approximately 40%-60%. Increasing the residence time resulted in increasing the removal efficiency and the order of destruction efficiency of VOCs followed the order styrene > o-xylene. Compared with the single compounds, the removal efficiency of styrene and o-xylene in the mixtures of VOCs decreased significantly and o-xylene decreased more rapidly. The degradation products were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the main compounds detected were O3, COx and benzene ring derivatives. The biodegradability of mixed VOCs was improved and the products had positive effect on biomass during plasma application, and furthermore typical results indicated that the biodegradability and biotoxicity of gaseous pollutant were quite depending on the specific input energy (SIE). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodegradability; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Mixed Vocs; Non-thermal Plasma; Removal Efficiency; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Ortho Xylene; Ozone; Styrene; Xylene; 2-xylene; Air Pollutants; Benzene Derivatives; Gases; Styrene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes; Benzene Derivative; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Ortho Xylene; Ozone; Styrene; 2-xylene; Air Pollutant; Gas; Volatile Organic Compound; Xylene; Biodegradation; Biotechnology; Concentration (composition); Organic Pollutant; Plasma; Pollutant Removal; Relative Humidity; Toxicity; Algal Growth; Article; Biodegradability; Biomass; Bioreactor; Biotransformation; Chlorella; Concentration (parameters); Decomposition; Dielectric Barrier Discharge Reactor; Electric Potential; Gas Chromatography; Growth Inhibition; Humidity; Mass Fragmentography; Nonhuman; Oxidation; Reaction Time; Bioremediation; Chemistry; Metabolism; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Air Pollutants; Benzene Derivatives; Biodegradation, Environmental; Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Gases; Oxidation-reduction; Styrene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes","benzene derivative; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; ortho xylene; ozone; styrene; 2-xylene; air pollutant; gas; volatile organic compound; xylene; biodegradation; biotechnology; concentration (composition); organic pollutant; plasma; pollutant removal; relative humidity; toxicity; algal growth; Article; biodegradability; biomass; bioreactor; biotransformation; Chlorella; concentration (parameters); decomposition; dielectric barrier discharge reactor; electric potential; gas chromatography; growth inhibition; humidity; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; oxidation; reaction time; bioremediation; chemistry; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Air Pollutants; Benzene Derivatives; Biodegradation, Environmental; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gases; Oxidation-Reduction; Styrene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes","","carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; ortho xylene, 95-47-6; ozone, 10028-15-6; styrene, 100-42-5; xylene, 1330-20-7; 2-xylene; Air Pollutants; Benzene Derivatives; Gases; Styrene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Xylenes","","Añón, J.

Also catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are exhaust gases from power plant and petrol-driven spark ignition engines, is an important element in the worldwide fight against air pollution. Microwave-assisted heating process using appropriate catalysts is confirmed to be effective for the oxidation of VOCs and the reduction of NOx and SO2. Oxidative and reductive catalysts composed of oxides, especially mixed oxide, are considered to be more suitable for the microwave-applied reactions than the supported precious metals used normally, because such oxides have a high absorption ability of microwave energy to be heated rapidly. Moreover, not only hot spots but also active sites formed by the microwave irradiation are sometimes different from those formed by the conventional heating, resulting in higher performance of catalysts for the oxidative and reductive reaction. It is noticeable that the extent of microwave effect on the oxidation activity of catalysts is different for the different substrates of VOCs, that is to say, oxidation of alkanes is more accelerated by the microwave irradiation than that of aldehydes. Microwave-assisted catalytic processes for the environmental purification, where a number of benefits including process time saving and increased process conversion are apparent, may be considered to be likely candidates for further development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Catalyst Oxides; Nox; Purification; Vocs","","","","","Spivey, James Jerry, Complete Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organics, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 26, 11, pp. 2165-2180, (1987); Añón, J.

Very high concentration ratios are possible (over 1000:1) depending on incoming VOC levels, or odor type. With the high concentration ratios attainable, very small final treatment/destruction devices are possible. Improvements in designed have addressed prior issues in maintainability and operating costs. FBC systems minimize the energy of the system by reducing the thermal oxidizer to a very small unit that almost runs self sustaining, with minimal natural gas input, and minimal secondary/greenhouse gas being produced.

This method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. The main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. Tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. This purifier is called biofilter.

In order to extend the packing material’s durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. Pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. According to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. When acetone was passed through biofilter’s packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%.

Results show that the optimum concentration of saponins in nutrient feed was 50.0mgL-1. When organic LR of n-hexane increased from 47.8 to 120.0gm-3h-1, the removal efficiency (RE) for BTF1 (with saponins) and BTF2 (without saponins) decreased from 91.3% to 83.3% and from 62.8% to 56.8%, respectively. As gas EBCT decreased from 30.0 to 7.5s, the RE declined from 88.4% to 64.5% for BTF1 and from 61.4% to 38.3% for BTF2.

The redox properties of 4Ce1M catalysts are significantly promoted due to the strong interaction between CeO<inf>2</inf> and MO<inf>x</inf>, which facilitates the destruction of the reactants and byproducts at lower temperature in the process of CVOCs oxidation. Especially, 4Ce1Cr catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity and selectivity, mainly due to the formation of Cr6+ species with strong oxidizing ability. 4Ce1Cr also represents good durability for DCE destruction during the 100h continuous test, and the chemical adsorbed Cl species on the surface can be removed above 325°C. Moreover, the presence of water or non-chlorinated VOCs can slightly decrease the conversion of chlorinated VOCs at lower temperature due to the competitive adsorption for active sites, while promote at higher temperature (above 300°C) because of the contribution to removing Cl species away from the surface. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Oxidation; Chlorinated Vocs; Mixed Oxides; Transition Metal; Byproducts; Catalyst Selectivity; Catalytic Oxidation; Chlorine; Durability; Metal Ions; Oxidation; Transition Metals; Chlorinated Vocs; Competitive Adsorption; Coprecipitation Method; Mesoporous Structures; Mixed Oxide; Mixed Oxide Catalysts; Strong Interaction; Transition Metal Compounds","Byproducts; Catalyst selectivity; Catalytic oxidation; Chlorine; Durability; Metal ions; Oxidation; Transition metals; Chlorinated VOCs; Competitive adsorption; Coprecipitation method; Mesoporous structures; Mixed oxide; Mixed oxide catalysts; Strong interaction; Transition metal compounds","","","We gratefully acknowledge the financial supports from Nature Science Foundation of China (no. 21177110 ) and Zhejiang Leading Team of Science and Technology Innovation (no. 2009R50020 ).","Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament Com 2005 446 Final, (2005); Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis, (2008); Añón, J.

While each separate process is able to degrade ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, a synergetic effect appears when they are combined at a pilot scale, leading to removal capacity higher than the sum of each separate process. The removal capacity is higher when the gas circulates at a higher flow rate and when pollutant concentration is higher. The presence of water vapor in the gas is detrimental to the efficiency of the process.

Recent studies pointed out that their contribution in terms of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other air pollutants is not negligible. Compared to classical removal technologies, non-thermal plasmas (NTP) showed better performances and low energy consumption when applied to treat lowly concentrated streams. Therefore, to study the feasibility of the application of NTP to MBTs, a Dielectric Barrier Discharge reactor was applied to treat a mixture of air and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), to simulate emissions from MBTs. The removal efficiency of MEK was linearly dependent upon time, power and specific input energy. Only 2-4% of MEK was converted to carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>), the remaining carbon being involved in the formation of byproducts (methyl nitrate and 2,3-butanedione, especially).

The organic pollutants must be present in the gas stream to be treated only in low concentrations. A case study was considered in which chlorobenzene was taken as the organic pollutant of reference. The application can be interesting when applied to industrial off-gases, especially if generated in the proximity of urban areas. Indeed, often in most industrialized regions of northern Italy, urban/industrial planning has not adequately separated the residential and productive areas: the presence of a number of small polluting activities can create critical conditions of human exposure even in the absence of large emitters. The system is developed according to two alternative process schemes (liquid–liquid separator equipped with a coalescer and separation using membrane process). The goal is twofold: from an environmental point of view, the aim is to treat the gas flow, limiting the dispersion into the atmosphere of hazardous pollutants; to this, an economic target should be added, with the opportunity to simultaneously retrieve reusable substances in industrial production cycles. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Treatment; Chlorobenzene; Material Recovery; Organic Pollutants; Atmospheric Pollution; Chlorobenzene; Concentration (composition); Organic Pollutant; Pollutant Removal; Pollutant Source; Pollution Exposure; Recovery; Urban Pollution; Italy","atmospheric pollution; chlorobenzene; concentration (composition); organic pollutant; pollutant removal; pollutant source; pollution exposure; recovery; urban pollution; Italy","","","","Añón, J.

Because of the structural features, they could accommodate around 90% of the metallic natural elements of the Periodic Table that stand solely or partially at the A and/or B positions without destroying the matrix structure, offering a way of correlating solid state chemistry to catalytic properties. Moreover, their high thermal and hydrothermal stability enable them suitable catalytic materials either for gas or solid reactions carried out at high temperatures, or liquid reactions carried out at low temperatures. In this review, we addressed the preparation, characterization, and application of perovskite oxides in heterogeneous catalysis. Preparation is an important issue in catalysis by which materials with desired textural structure and physicochemical property could be achieved; characterization is the way to explore and understand the textural structures and physicochemical properties of the material; however, application reflects how and where the material could be used and what it can solve in practice, which is the ultimate goal of catalysis. This review is organized in five sections: (1) a brief introduction to perovskite oxides, (2) preparation of perovskite oxides with different textural structures and surface morphologies, (3) general characterizations applied to perovskite oxides, (4) application of perovskite oxides in heterogeneous catalysis, and (5) conclusions and perspectives. We expected that the overview on these achievements could lead to research on the nature of catalytic performances of perovskite oxides and finally commercialization of them for industrial use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysis; Characterizations; Perovskite Oxide; Preparation; Surface Morphology; Characterization; Surface Morphology; Perovskite Oxides; Preparation; Catalysis","Characterization; Surface morphology; Perovskite oxides; preparation; Catalysis","","","","Añón, J.

The result shows that removal of DCM is higher for Fe-C mixed packing than for iron mash or activate carbon one. Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) of solution in the reactor filled with Fe-C mixed packing rapidly drops, which can create a more reducing environment at around 180 mV, while for other two fillers there is significant difference. It was also found that removal and dechlorination of DCM can be enhanced when pH of aqueous solution decreases. After 300 min the Cl- concentration in solution is about 4 times higher at pH 1.5 than at pH 5, and the maximum rate of Cl- generation is 2.85%.

Plasma was generated inside the porous ceramic by applying an alternating current (AC) voltage to the coaxial electrodes. The tandem plasma-catalytic reactor consisted of two ceramic-supported catalysts containing zinc oxide (ZnO) and/or manganese oxide (MnO<inf>2</inf>), in which the first supported catalyst was exposed to the plasma discharge and the second one was placed in the post-plasma region. Several sets of catalyst arrangements such as MnO<inf>2</inf>-loaded monolith followed by bare monolith, ZnO-loaded monolith followed by bare monolith, ZnO-loaded monolith followed by MnO<inf>2</inf>-loaded monolith and two consecutive MnO<inf>2</inf>-loaded monoliths with different Mn contents were examined in relation to the acetone decomposition and the byproducts formation. More than 90% of acetone was decomposed at a specific input energy (SIE) of about 1.0kJL-1 with the catalyst arrangement of MnO<inf>2</inf> (0.1% Mn) followed by MnO<inf>2</inf> (5.0% Mn), while the decomposition efficiency obtained with two consecutive bare monoliths was about 66% at the same SIE. The use of ZnO in the plasma discharge region did not largely improve the acetone decomposition efficiency. Wherever it is placed either in the plasma discharge region or in the post-plasma region, MnO<inf>2</inf> catalyst substantially promoted the acetone decomposition, obviously due to the dissociation of ozone into far more reactive oxygen atoms available for oxidizing acetone molecules. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetone Decomposition; Catalyst; Dbd Plasma; Manganese Dioxide; Zinc Oxide; Acetone; Catalysts; Catalytic Oxidation; Electric Discharges; Electric Impedance Measurement; Ii-vi Semiconductors; Manganese Oxide; Oxide Minerals; Zinc Oxide; Alternating Current Voltages; Dbd Plasma; Decomposition Efficiency; Manganese Dioxide; Oxidative Decomposition; Plasma Catalytic Reactors; Plasma Discharge Region; Specific Input Energies; Catalyst Supports","Acetone; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Electric discharges; Electric impedance measurement; II-VI semiconductors; Manganese oxide; Oxide minerals; Zinc oxide; Alternating current voltages; DBD plasma; Decomposition efficiency; Manganese dioxide; Oxidative decomposition; Plasma catalytic reactors; Plasma discharge region; Specific input energies; Catalyst supports","","","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and future Planning (Grant No. 2013R1A2A2A01067961 ).","Añón, J.

In the third part, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to follow the alumina surface during acetaldehyde adsorption. DRIFTS measurements demonstrated that besides the bands of molecularly adsorbed acetaldehyde, several absorptions appeared on the spectra showing the intermediate surface transformation of acetaldehyde already at 300K.

The biofilter and photoreactor were operated at gas residence times of 1.20 and 0.14min, respectively, and a hexane loading rate of 115±5gm-3h-1. Steady n-hexane elimination capacities of 30-40gm-3h-1 were achieved, concomitantly with pollutant mineralization efficiencies of 60-90%. No significant influence of biofilter irrigation frequency or irrigation nitrogen concentration on hexane abatement was recorded. Photolysis did not support an efficient hexane post-treatment likely due to the short EBRT applied in the photoreactor, while overall hexane removal and mineralization enhancements of 25% were recorded when the irradiated photoreactor was packed with ZnO-impregnated perlite. However, a rapid catalyst deactivation was observed, which required a periodic reactivation every 48h. Biofilter irrigation every 3 days supported fungal spore emissions at concentrations ranging from 2.4×103 to 9.0×104CFUm-3. Finally, spore deactivation efficiencies of ≈98% were recorded for the photolytic and photocatalytic post-treatment processes. This study confirmed the potential of photo-assisted post-treatment processes to mitigate the emission of hazardous fungal spores and boost the abatement performance of biotechnologies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fungal Biofilter; Hexane; Hybrid Treatment; Photo-treatment; Spores; Hexane; Hexanes; Biofilters; Biohazards; Emission Control; Fungi; Hexane; Irrigation; Mineralogy; Photolysis; Elimination Capacity; Fungal Biofilter; Hybrid Treatment; Irrigation Frequency; Nitrogen Concentrations; Photo-treatment; Post-treatment Process; Spores; Loading; Hexane; Biofiltration; Biomineralization; Concentration (composition); Fungus; Spore; Air Pollution Control; Article; Biodegradation; Biofilter; Catalyst; Colony Forming Unit M; Fungus Spore; Gas; Mineralization; Nitrogen Concentration; Photolysis; Photoreactor; Reactor; Filtration; Isolation And Purification; Metabolism; Photobioreactor; Procedures; Filtration; Hexanes; Photobioreactors","Biofilters; Biohazards; Emission control; Fungi; Hexane; Irrigation; Mineralogy; Photolysis; Elimination capacity; Fungal biofilter; Hybrid treatment; Irrigation frequency; Nitrogen concentrations; Photo-treatment; Post-treatment process; Spores; Loading; hexane; biofiltration; biomineralization; concentration (composition); fungus; spore; air pollution control; article; biodegradation; biofilter; catalyst; colony forming unit M; fungus spore; gas; mineralization; nitrogen concentration; photolysis; photoreactor; reactor; filtration; isolation and purification; metabolism; photobioreactor; procedures; Filtration; Hexanes; Photobioreactors","","hexane, 110-54-3; Hexanes","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness ( JCI-2011-11009 , CTQ-2012-34949 and CONSOLIDER-CSD 2007-00055 projects).

The composite TiO<inf>2</inf>/SiO<inf>2</inf> particles have been further introduced in bulk paper to generate highly active photocatalytic TiO<inf>2</inf>-loaded papers. The activity of the papers has been demonstrated in the room-temperature degradation of ethanol (50-200ppm) under UV irradiation, showing a comparable activity to that of commercial TiO<inf>2</inf>-coated papers. The effect of the main textural variables during papermaking on the photocatalytic performance are discussed in detail. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethanol; Paper; Photocatalysis; Silica; Sol-gel; Cellulose Fibres; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic Materials; Photocatalytic Performance; Room Temperature; Silica Particles; Sol-gel Synthesis; Titania Nano-particles; Calcium Carbonate; Ethanol; Nanoparticles; Photocatalysis; Photodegradation; Silica; Sol-gel Process; Sol-gels; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium Dioxide; Paper; Calcium Carbonate; Catalysts; Synthesis; Titanium Dioxide","Cellulose fibres; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic materials; Photocatalytic performance; Room temperature; Silica particles; Sol-gel synthesis; Titania nano-particles; Calcium carbonate; Ethanol; Nanoparticles; Photocatalysis; Photodegradation; Silica; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Paper; Calcium Carbonate; Catalysts; Synthesis; Titanium Dioxide","","","","undefined; undefined; undefined, (2011); Atkinson, Roger, Atmospheric chemistry of VOCs and NO(x), Atmospheric Environment, 34, 12-14, pp. 2063-2101, (2000); Bernstein, Jonathan A., The health effects of nonindustrial indoor air pollution, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 121, 3, pp. 585-591, (2008); Añón, J.

Volatile organic compounds in particular have various effects on health and their abatement is a key issue. Different ways to couple non-thermal plasmas with catalytic or adsorbing materials are listed. In particular, a comparison between in-plasma and post-plasma coupling is made. Studies dealing with plasma-induced heterogeneous reactivity are analysed, as well as the possible modifications of the catalyst surface under plasma exposure. As an alternative to the conventional and widely studied plasma-catalyst coupling, a sequential approach has been recently proposed whereby pollutants are first adsorbed onto the material, then oxidized by switching on the plasma.

In this report, using biochemical and immunological assays, we show that exposure to 0.5 ppm 1-octen-3-ol induces a nitric oxide (NO) mediated inflammatory response in hemocytes, Drosophila innate immune cells. Moreover, exposed Drosophila brains show increased peroxynitrite expression. An increase in nitrite levels is observed with toluene and 1-octen-3-ol but not with 1-butanol. Pharmacological inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) namely, L-NAME, D-NAME and minocycline, and NOS mutants show improvements of life span among 1-octen-3-ol exposed flies. Exposure to 1-octen-3-ol also induces NOS expression in larval tracheal tissues and remodels tracheal epithelial lining. These findings suggest a possible mechanistic basis for some of the reported adverse health effects attributed to mold exposure and demonstrates the utility of this in vivo Drosophila model to complement existing model systems for understanding the role of inflammation in VOC-mediated toxicity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","N(g) Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Ng-nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Rna, Messenger; Volatile Organic Compounds; Messenger Rna; N(g) Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Volatile Organic Compound; Animal; Antagonists And Inhibitors; Brain; Cell Proliferation; Chemically Induced; Chemistry; Drosophila Melanogaster; Drug Effects; Enzyme Immunoassay; Fungus; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Immunology; Inflammation; Larva; Metabolism; Pathology; Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Transgenic Animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Cell Proliferation; Fungi; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Inflammation; Larva; Ng-nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna, Messenger; Volatile Organic Compounds","messenger RNA; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; volatile organic compound; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; brain; cell proliferation; chemically induced; chemistry; Drosophila melanogaster; drug effects; enzyme immunoassay; fungus; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; inflammation; larva; metabolism; pathology; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Cell Proliferation; Fungi; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Inflammation; Larva; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Volatile Organic Compounds","","n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester, 50903-99-6; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitric oxide synthase, 125978-95-2; NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; RNA, Messenger; Volatile Organic Compounds","This work was supported by the Rutgers University Reserve Funding to JWB.

The temperature swing oxidation of BTX consists of two stages: adsorption of the VOC from the stream saturating the adsorbent-catalyst at different levels and catalytic oxidation of concentrated VOC induced by raising bed temperature at different flow rates of regenerative air. The results indicate that at lower saturation levels and lower flow rates of regenerative air a complete oxidation performance is better.

The materials obtained were tested as catalysts for ethyl acetate oxidation, as a model volatile organic compound. La-Cu samples showed poor catalytic performance, but La-Co materials were much more active than the individual components. Catalytic activity seems to be mainly determined by the easiness of reduction of the catalysts, which is related to the availability of oxygen from the lattice. Catalysts containing Co or Cu in excess of La (on a molar base) were more active than the corresponding mixed oxides consisting of equal amounts of La and the transition metal. Samples prepared by the evaporation method were more active than those prepared by exotemplating, for the same molar ratio. Samples prepared by evaporation and glycine-nitrate methods calcined at 600°C had a better performance than the corresponding oxides calcined at 300°C.

Nanoparticles similar in size [transmission electron microscopy (TEM) diameter of ∼1 nm] but with different shapes were prepared via encapsulation in inverse micelles. The NP shape was resolved by combining information extracted from extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) data, TEM, and modeling. A correlation was observed between the average first nearest neighbor coordination number of atoms at the NP surface and their catalytic activity. In particular, the NPs with the largest number of weakly coordinated surface atoms (i.e., edges and corners) were found to be the least active for the total oxidation of 2-butanol.

VOC screening was performed by means of HRGC-MS analysis of samples taken at the inlet and at the outlet of the nonthermal plasma system. Odor concentration by means of dynamic olfactometry, total organic carbon, mercaptans, NH<inf>3</inf>, and H<inf>2</inf>S were also determined in order to assess the performance of the system throughout several days. Three plasma frequencies (100, 150, and 200 Hz) and two catalyst temperatures (150°C and 50°C) were also tested. Under conditions of maximum capacity of the treatment system, the results show VOC depuration efficiencies around 69%, with average depuration efficiencies between 44 and 95% depending on the chemical family of the substance. Compounds belonging to the following families have been detected in the samples: organic acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, pyrazines, and reduced sulphur compounds, among others. Average total organic carbon removal efficiency was 88%, while NH<inf>3</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>S removal efficiencies were 88% and 87%, respectively, and odor concentration abatement was 78%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Final Report, (2010); Añón, J.

The control of the emissions of VOCs into the atmosphere is presently one of the major environmental problems. Many conventional methods have been developed for industrial gaseous waste treatment but adsorption of contaminants onto adsorbents and their subsequent desorption for reuse or destruction has acquired high approval. Adsorption has been shown to be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly process compared to other technologies such as absorption, biofiltration, or thermal catalysis. This chapter summarizes the general backgrounds, described in the literature, related to the control of the emissions of VOCs. First, a state of the art of the sources of emissions of VOCs, and their main effects to human health and environment is presented. Then, the main technologies for VOCs control, their principles, limitations, applications and their remediation costs are briefly reviewed. Finally, the use of natural adsorbents as an economic alternative for the abatement of VOCs is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Clays; Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compounds(vocs); Clay; Cost Effectiveness; Gas Chromatography; Industrial Waste Treatment; Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Adsorption Process; Conventional Methods; Environmental Problems; Environmentally Friendly Process; Natural Adsorbents; Remediation Costs; State Of The Art; Toxic Substances; Adsorption","Clay; Cost effectiveness; Gas chromatography; Industrial waste treatment; Oxidation; Volatile organic compounds; Adsorption process; Conventional methods; Environmental problems; Environmentally friendly process; Natural adsorbents; Remediation costs; State of the art; Toxic substances; Adsorption","","","","La Reduction Des Emissions De Composes Organiques Volatils Dans L Industrie Ademe Editions, (1997); Añón, J.

Both TBABs were loaded with pelletized diatomaceous earth support media and run at an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 120 s. TBABs ""A"" and ""B"" were operated at pH 4 and fed with n-hexane:benzene:methanol (C<inf>H</inf>:C <inf>B</inf>:C<inf>M</inf>) concentrations ratios of 1:3:10 and 1:3:6.6, respectively under different loading rates. The influent total loading rates varied from 39.2 to 117.7 g/m3h and from 32 to 96.4 g/m3h for TBABs ""A"" and ""B"", respectively. In both TBABs, methanol and benzene were the most eliminated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while the removal of n-hexane was controlled by the VOCs ratios. Higher removal efficiencies were obtained for the VOCs ratio of 1:3:6.6 corresponding to a total VOCs load of 96.4 g/m3h. The addition of VOCs mixture to the TBABs resulted in change of the fungi community within the TBABs as compared to the fungi community when the TBABs were previously receiving only n-hexane as a sole substrate. © 2014 Springer International Publishing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzene; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Fungi; Methanol; N-hexane; Recalcitrant Compounds; Trickle Bed Air Biofilters (tbab); Benzene; Carbon Dioxide; Hexane; Methanol; Benzene; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Fungi; Hexane; Methanol; Mixtures; Volatile Organic Compounds; Diatomaceous Earth; Empty Bed Residence Time; Hydrophobic And Hydrophilic; N-hexane; Recalcitrant Compounds; Removal Efficiencies; Trickle Bed Air Biofilters; Trickle-bed Air Biofilter; Loading; Benzene; Carbon Dioxide; Hexane; Methanol; Volatile Organic Compound; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Fungus; Hydrophobicity; Substrate; Acidity; Air Pollution; Article; Biofilter; Biomass; Bioremediation; Chemical Reaction; Controlled Study; Fungal Strain; Fusarium Moniliforme; Fusarium Solani; Hydrophilicity; Microbial Community; Nonhuman; Ph; Trickle Bed Air Biofilter; Waste Component Removal","Benzene; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Fungi; Hexane; Methanol; Mixtures; Volatile organic compounds; Diatomaceous earth; Empty bed residence time; Hydrophobic and hydrophilic; N-Hexane; Recalcitrant compounds; Removal efficiencies; Trickle bed air biofilters; Trickle-bed air biofilter; Loading; benzene; carbon dioxide; hexane; methanol; volatile organic compound; biodegradation; biofiltration; fungus; hydrophobicity; substrate; acidity; air pollution; article; biofilter; biomass; bioremediation; chemical reaction; controlled study; fungal strain; Fusarium moniliforme; Fusarium solani; hydrophilicity; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; trickle bed air biofilter; waste component removal","","benzene, 71-43-2; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; hexane, 110-54-3; methanol, 67-56-1","","Añón, J.

Several methods of controlling VOCs exist. Most of them have direct or indirect environmental consequences in terms of materials they use and wastes they produce albeit control VOCs. It has been found that conventional techniques especially of physical and chemical nature pose a number of problems such as high on cost, high material requirement, produce lots of waste and contribute to climate change and environmental degradation. Various biological oxidation methods adopted in various reactors for controlling gaseous VOCs have been reviewed, pros and cons of these technologies have been studied and the sensitive parameters for improving removal efficiency along with their environmental implications have been identified. It has been found that rotating biological contactor (RBC) could be an effective alternative to control gaseous VOCs because of its simple design and operation. Further, it provides higher oxygen transfer, offers better mixing, consumes low energy and has potential of higher removal efficiency as compared to the other biological techniques. There is, moreover, an ample scope in improving its gaseous-control efficiency by optimizing the parameters like rotational speed, hydraulic loading rate, and hydraulic retention time and similarly by the use of different media, biofilm characteristics and dissolved-oxygen levels. With these scopes, RBC can be an eco-friendly, and promising option for controlling gaseous VOCs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Oxidation; Co2; Rbc; Removal Efficiency; Voc; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Dissolved Oxygen; Environmental Protection; Environmental Technology; Oxidation; Oxygen; Volatile Organic Compounds; Biological Oxidations; Conventional Techniques; Environmental Consequences; Environmental Implications; Hydraulic Retention Time; Rbc; Removal Efficiencies; Rotating Biological Contactor; Loading","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dissolved oxygen; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Oxidation; Oxygen; Volatile organic compounds; Biological oxidations; Conventional techniques; Environmental consequences; Environmental implications; Hydraulic retention time; RBC; Removal efficiencies; Rotating biological contactor; Loading","","","","Añón, J.

Further, the catalytic oxidation of biobutanol over Pt catalysts was studied to investigate the behaviour of butanol as a fuel in the combustion engine. After the hydrothermal treatment of green and yellowish barley silage followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, approximately 88% and 100% of the available sugars were recovered, respectively. Batch fermentations of pretreatment barley silage liquor, supplemented with gelatinised barley grain, showed good fermentability with total ABE concentrations of 9.0. g/L and 10.9. g/L. Butanol yields of 0.20, 0.17 and ABE yields of 0.28, 0.26 (g/g monosaccharide) were obtained, respectively. In catalytic activity measurements, the conversion of biobutanol became appreciable in the 120-140. °C range, whereas conversions greater than 95% were obtained over 200. °C.

The coupled sliding discharge (CSD) reactor based on this concept was found to be scalable by stacking and operating multiple electrode assemblies in parallel, similarly to the shielded sliding discharge (SSD) reactor reported earlier. A comparison of the two systems showed that although the energy density in the CSD reactor was lower, the efficiency for NO conversion and ozone synthesis from dry air were significantly higher. The energy cost for 50 % NO removal was ~30 eV/molecule compared to ~60 eV/molecule in the case of the SSD under the same conditions of 330 ppm initial NO concentration in air. The energy cost decreased to ~12 eV/molecule in both cases when NO was mixed with plasma-activated air at the outlet of the reactor to utilize ozone for NO conversion i.e., indirect plasma treatment. The energy yield for ozone generation from dry air was at ~70 g/kWh, comparable in both systems. The results show that the concept of a CSD, as that of SSDs, allows the construction of compact, efficient plasma reactors. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coupled Sliding Discharges; Nanosecond Discharges; Nitric Oxide; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone; Shielded Sliding Discharges; Electric Discharges; Nitric Oxide; Ozone; Ozone Layer; Plasma Applications; Plasma Devices; Plasma Theory; Multiple Electrodes; Nanosecond Discharge; Negative Streamers; No Concentration; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Generation; Plasma Treatment; Sliding Discharges; Coupled Circuits","Electric discharges; Nitric oxide; Ozone; Ozone layer; Plasma applications; Plasma devices; Plasma theory; Multiple electrodes; Nanosecond discharge; Negative streamers; NO concentration; Nonthermal plasma; Ozone generation; Plasma treatment; Sliding discharges; Coupled circuits","","","Acknowledgments This work is supported by a Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund grant (MF13-019-Env.) from Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology, Air Force Office of Scientific Research under AFOSR Award No. FA9550-11-1-0190, ‘Frank Reidy Fellowship in Environmental Plasma Research’, and internal funds of the Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics.","Malik, Muhammad Arif, Catalyst enhanced oxidation of VOCs and methane in cold-plasma reactors, Platinum Metals Review, 43, 3, pp. 109-113, (1999); Añón, J.

UV/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, Fenton, photo-Fenton and ozone treatments were tested at mild conditions and the oxidation efficiency obtained was compared. The oxidation tests were carried out in magnetically stirred cylindrical quartz reactors using the same molar concentration of oxidants (hydrogen peroxide or ozone). The results show that ozone and photo-Fenton are the most efficient treatments, achieving up to 95% of sulphur compounds oxidation and a mineralisation degree around 70% in 10min. Furthermore, the total costs of the treatments taking into account the capital and operational costs were also estimated for a comparative purpose. The economic analysis revealed that the Fenton treatment is the most economical option to be integrated in a wet scrubber to remove volatile organic sulphur compounds, as long as there are no space constraints to install the required reactor volume. In the case of reactor volume limitation or retrofitting complexities, the ozone and photo-Fenton treatments should be considered as viable alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aop; Fenton; Odour; Ozone; Sulphur Compound; Uv; Dimethyl Disulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Hydrogen Peroxide; Ozone; Silicon Dioxide; Economic Analysis; Molar Concentration; Odors; Ozone; Scrubbers; Sulfur Compounds; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Dimethyl Disulphide; Dimethyl Sulphide; Efficient Treatment; Fenton; Oxidation Efficiency; Photo-fenton Treatments; Space Constraints; Oxidation; Dimethyl Disulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Hydrogen Peroxide; Organosulfur Derivative; Ozone; Silicon Dioxide; Thiol; Volatile Organic Compound; Aqueous Solution; Dimethylsulfide; Odor; Oxidation; Pollutant Removal; Sulfur Compound; Article; Cost; Magnetism; Mineralization; Ph; Photochemistry; Pressure; Room Temperature; Stirred Reactor; Ultraviolet Radiation; Waste Component Removal; Aop; Odour; Sulphur Compound; Uv; Chromatography, Gas; Disulfides; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Oxidation-reduction; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Ultraviolet Rays; Water Purification","Economic analysis; Molar concentration; Odors; Ozone; Scrubbers; Sulfur compounds; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Dimethyl disulphide; Dimethyl sulphide; Efficient treatment; Fenton; Oxidation efficiency; Photo-Fenton treatments; Space constraints; Oxidation; dimethyl disulfide; dimethyl sulfide; hydrogen peroxide; organosulfur derivative; ozone; silicon dioxide; thiol; volatile organic compound; aqueous solution; dimethylsulfide; odor; oxidation; pollutant removal; sulfur compound; article; cost; magnetism; mineralization; pH; photochemistry; pressure; room temperature; stirred reactor; ultraviolet radiation; waste component removal; AOP; Odour; Sulphur compound; UV; Chromatography, Gas; Disulfides; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfides; Ultraviolet Rays; Water Purification","","dimethyl disulfide, 624-92-0; dimethyl sulfide, 75-18-3; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; ozone, 10028-15-6; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9","R.

Speed School of Engineering, Louisville, United States","Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), present in the exhaust gas from the biosolids drying system, are required to be destroyed prior to the exhaust gas being released to the ambient air. Biogas, a byproduct of the waste sludge treatment process, can fire the dryer instead of natural gas, a common source of energy. Biogas' components, typically a combination of methane, carbon dioxide, and other traces gases, and the destruction of VOCs released from biosolids drying will depend on the type of waste sludge being treated at the plant. Therefore, biogas utilization can raise concerns as to whether using biogas adds to the VOC emissions that could subject the plant to hazardous air pollutant (HAP) regulations. Research was conducted at an industrial scale to study potential emission differences from the final regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) of the dryer exhaust gases when the biosolids drying system was fueled by natural gas and biogas at the Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center (MFWQTC) in Louisville, Kentucky. Analyzed samples taken from the RTO's exhaust demonstrated that the RTO's flue gas emission difference between the two modes averaged between 2 and 10 μg/m3 for the selected compounds, an insignificant difference. This indicates that biogas, a free byproduct at the plant, is most likely as clean as the costly natural gas, and should be considered an economical renewable source of energy without causing an unsound elevation in harmful emissions. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert Inc. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogas; Drum Dryer; Natural Gas; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer; Volatile Organic Compounds; Carbon Dioxide; Methane; Natural Gas; Biogas; Biological Materials; Biosolids; Carbon Dioxide; Dryers (equipment); Drying; Exhaust Gases; Industrial Emissions; Industrial Research; Methane; Natural Gas; Regenerators; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Quality; Biogas Utilization; Drying Systems; Harmful Emissions; Hazardous Air Pollutants; Industrial Scale; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers; Renewable Sources; Voc Emissions; Biohazards; Biogas; Carbon Dioxide; Methane; Natural Gas; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Pollutant; Ambient Air; Article; Biosolid; Biosolid Drying; Exhaust Gas; Hazard Assessment; Renewable Energy; Sludge Drying; Sludge Treatment; United States","Biogas; Biological materials; Biosolids; Carbon dioxide; Dryers (equipment); Drying; Exhaust gases; Industrial emissions; Industrial research; Methane; Natural gas; Regenerators; Volatile organic compounds; Water quality; Biogas utilization; Drying systems; Harmful emissions; Hazardous air pollutants; Industrial scale; Regenerative thermal oxidizers; Renewable sources; VOC emissions; Biohazards; biogas; carbon dioxide; methane; natural gas; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; ambient air; article; biosolid; biosolid drying; exhaust gas; hazard assessment; renewable energy; sludge drying; sludge treatment; United States","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8; natural gas, 8006-14-2","","Añón, J.

The study reports a microwave catalytic reactor with V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst for oxidation decomposition of dimethyl sulfide. RESULTS: A combination of microwave and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> or microwave combined with V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and ozone as an oxidant completely converted DMS. The effect of DMS removal using microwave and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> is close to that of catalytic oxidizing of DMS using ozone and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>. Microwave accentuates catalytic oxidation of DMS, and increases DMS removal efficiency. The addition of ozone to microwave catalysis over V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> leads to the enhancement of DMS removal. (CH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>SO, HCOOCH<inf>3</inf> and SCO species are formed in the microwave catalytic DMS reaction. The mechanism of microwave catalytic DMS over V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> was dominated by a free radical oxidation route. (CH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>SO, (CH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>2</inf>, SCO and CH<inf>3</inf>OH species are formed in the microwave catalytic oxidation of DMS. CONCLUSION: Ozone enhances free radical formation. Oxidative reactions involving ozone and radicals play the dominant role in the destruction of DMS molecules using a microwave combined with V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst using ozone as an oxidant. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dimethyl Sulfide(dms); Microwave Catalytic; Microwave Catalytic Oxidation; Odor; Aluminum Oxide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Ozone; Aluminum; Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic Oxidation; Free Radicals; Odors; Oxidants; Ozone; Sulfur Dioxide; Catalytic Reactor; Dimethyl Sulfide; Environment Quality; Free Radical Oxidation; Microwave Catalysis; Oxidative Reaction; Radical Formation; Removal Efficiencies; Microwaves; Aluminum Oxide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Free Radical; Oxidizing Agent; Ozone; Unclassified Drug; Vanadium Derivative; Vanadium Oxide; Article; Catalysis; Catalyst; Decomposition; Microwave Irradiation; Oxidation; Reaction Analysis","Aluminum; Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Free radicals; Odors; Oxidants; Ozone; Sulfur dioxide; Catalytic reactor; Dimethyl sulfide; Environment quality; Free radical oxidation; Microwave catalysis; Oxidative reaction; Radical formation; Removal efficiencies; Microwaves; aluminum oxide; dimethyl sulfide; free radical; oxidizing agent; ozone; unclassified drug; vanadium derivative; vanadium oxide; article; catalysis; catalyst; decomposition; microwave irradiation; oxidation; reaction analysis","","aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; dimethyl sulfide, 75-18-3; ozone, 10028-15-6","","Añón, J.

In this reactor, electrodes are placed on top of a dielectric layer and one of the electrodes, generally the one on ground potential, is connected to a conductive layer on the opposite side of the dielectric. The energy per pulse, at the same applied voltage, was more than a factor of seven higher than that of pulsed corona discharges, and more than a factor of two higher than that of sliding discharges without a shield. It is explained on the basis of enhanced electric fields, particularly at the plasma emitting electrode. Specific input energy required for 50 % removal from ~1,000 ppm initial NO could be reduced to ~18 eV/molecule when ozone in the exhaust of negative streamers was utilized. For sliding discharges and pulsed corona discharges this value was ~25 eV/molecule and it was 35 eV/molecule for positive shielded sliding discharges. Also, the ozone energy yield from dry air was up to ~130 g/kW h and highest for negative streamer discharges in shielded sliding discharge reactors. The high energy density in negative streamer discharges in the shielded discharge reactor at the relatively low applied voltages might not only allow expansion of basic studies on negative streamers, but also open the path to industrial applications, which have so far been focused on positive streamer discharges. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Negative Streamer Discharges; Nitric Oxide Conversion; Non-thermal Plasma; Ozone Generation; Positive Streamer Discharges; Pulsed Corona Discharges; Shielded Sliding Discharges; Sliding Discharges; Negative Streamers; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone Generation; Positive Streamers; Pulsed Corona Discharges; Sliding Discharges; Atmospheric Pressure; Electric Corona; Electric Fields; Electrodes; Industrial Applications; Nitric Oxide; Ozone; Ozone Layer; Electric Discharges","Negative streamers; Nonthermal plasma; Ozone generation; Positive streamers; Pulsed corona discharges; Sliding discharges; Atmospheric pressure; Electric corona; Electric fields; Electrodes; Industrial applications; Nitric oxide; Ozone; Ozone layer; Electric discharges","","","Acknowledgments This work is supported by a Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund grant (MF13-019) from Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology, ‘Frank Reidy Fellowship in Environmental Plasma Research’ and with internal funds of the Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics.","Añón, J.

The electrode configuration not only allowed rearranging discharges in parallel due to the decoupling effect of the metal layer, but also to modify the electric field distribution in such a way that components normal to the surface are enhanced, leading to an increased energy density in the discharge plasma. By varying the electrode gap, the applied voltage, and the repetition rate, it is shown that by keeping the average electric field constant, the discharge voltage can be reduced from tens of kV to values on the order of a few kV, but only at the expense of a reduced energy density of the plasma. Varying the repetition rate from 20 to 500 Hz resulted in a slightly reduced energy per pulse, likely caused by residual charges on the dielectric surface. Measurements of the NO conversion to NO<inf>2</inf> and ozone synthesis in dry air showed that the conversion is only dependent on the energy density of the discharge plasma. Although reducing the pulse voltage from the tens of kV range to that of few kV, and possibly even lower, causes a reduction in energy density, this loss can be compensated for by increasing the electrode gap area. This and the possibility to form discharge arrays allows generating large volume discharge reactors for environmental applications, at modest pulsed voltages. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Nanosecond Discharges; Nitric Oxide; Nonthermal Plasma; Ozone; Shielded Sliding Discharges; Streamer Discharges; Electric Field Distributions; Electrode Configurations; Environmental Applications; Large Volume Discharge; Nanosecond Discharge; Nonthermal Plasma; Sliding Discharges; Streamer Discharges; Air Pollution; Electric Fields; Nitric Oxide; Ozone; Plasma Theory; Surface Discharges; Electric Discharges","Electric field distributions; Electrode configurations; Environmental applications; Large volume discharge; Nanosecond discharge; Nonthermal plasma; Sliding discharges; Streamer discharges; Air pollution; Electric fields; Nitric oxide; Ozone; Plasma theory; Surface discharges; Electric discharges","","","Acknowledgments This work is supported by a Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund grant (MF13-019) from Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology, ‘Frank Reidy Fellowship in Environmental Plasma Research’ and with internal funds of the Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics.","Añón, J.

These catalysts are then tested for the complete oxidation of n-butanol and acetic acid. It has been shown that the addition of ceria to alumina influences the physico-chemical properties of the materials and their catalytic activities. A decrease of the surface area is observed when adding ceria to alumina. Moreover XRD patterns show that the addition of low concentrations of ceria (7 and 15wt%) leads to a loss of the alumina structure while the material with a higher ceria loading shows typical crystallized CeO<inf>2</inf> patterns. The reducibility of the materials is enhanced with the increasing ceria loading, which is in accordance with the OSC measurements. Addition of ceria results in the improvement of catalytic performance for n-butanol and acetic acid oxidations even if it also leads to a formation of numerous intermediate products that have mainly been attributed to the actives sites of ceria. A reaction pathway is proposed to explain the formation of these intermediates. The nature of the VOC is found to influence the effect of the addition of ceria on the catalytic activity. In fact, this effect is more pronounced for acetic acid oxidation than n-butanol transformation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetic Acid; Alumina; Ceria; Mixed Oxides; N-butanol; Osc; Oxidation; Voc; Acetic Acid; Aluminum Oxide; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cerium Oxide; Field Emission Microscopes; High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Hydrogen Storage; Ph; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Sol-gel Process; Sol-gels; X Ray Diffraction; Alumina Catalysts; High-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy; Hydrogen Chemisorption; Inductively-coupled Plasma; Mixed Oxide; N-butanol; Oxygen Storage Capacity; Promoting Effect; Pt Catalysts; Sol- Gel Methods; Alumina","Acetic acid; Aluminum oxide; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium oxide; Field emission microscopes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen storage; pH; Scanning electron microscopy; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; X ray diffraction; Alumina catalysts; High-resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen chemisorption; Inductively-coupled plasma; Mixed oxide; N-butanol; Oxygen storage capacity; Promoting effect; Pt catalysts; Sol- gel methods; Alumina","","","","Añón, J.

Pleated structures of MFECs containing Pd/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O <inf>3</inf>, Pd-Mn/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and Pd-Ce/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> were investigated systematically for volatile organic compound (VOC) removal at various face velocities (ca. 3-30 m/s) and at low temperatures (<473 K). The optimized structure of MFEC (e.g., W-structure with 8 μm Ni fiber) resulted intralayer residence times from 750 to 65 μs with pressure drops from 0.35 to 10.22 kPa. The study exhibited that low intralayer residence times had a significant effect on the catalytic reaction which followed the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism in this velocity controlled region. The overall reaction rate for VOC removal was limited by the surface reaction. Furthermore, mixed metal oxide based MFECs showed better performance in VOC removal due to the high oxygen storage capacity of reducible oxides. The performance of pleated MFEC was calculated in terms of heterogeneous contacting efficiency (η<inf>HCE</inf>), which relies on the logarithmic removal of reactant concentrations per unit of the pressure drop. © 2013 American Chemical Society. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Materials; Catalytic Reactions; Heterogeneous Contacting; Mars-van Krevelen Mechanisms; Microfibrous Entrapped Catalysts; Optimized Structures; Reactant Concentrations; Volatile Organic Compound Removals; Catalysis; Catalysts; Nickel; Palladium; Pressure Drop; Surface Reactions; Volatile Organic Compounds; Aluminum","Catalytic materials; Catalytic reactions; Heterogeneous contacting; Mars-van krevelen mechanisms; Microfibrous entrapped catalysts; Optimized structures; Reactant concentrations; Volatile organic compound removals; Catalysis; Catalysts; Nickel; Palladium; Pressure drop; Surface reactions; Volatile organic compounds; Aluminum","","","","Añón, J.

Compared to other human diseases such as cancer, studies on VOC analysis in cases of infectious diseases are limited. Here, we have described results of studies which have used some of the appropriate technologies to evaluate VOC biomarkers and biomarker profiles associated with infections. The publications reviewed include important infections of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and nasal cavity. The results highlight the use of VOC biomarker profiles resulting from certain infectious diseases in discriminating between infected and healthy subjects. Infection- related VOC profiles measured in exhaled breath as well as from headspaces of feces or urine samples are a source of information with respect to disease detection. The volatiles emitted in clinical matrices may on the one hand represent metabolites of the infecting pathogen or on the other hand reflect pathogen-induced host responses or, indeed, a combination of both. Because exhaled- breath samples are easy to collect and online instruments are commercially available, VOC analysis in exhaled breath appears to be a promising tool for noninvasive detection and monitoring of infectious diseases. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

Although these concentrations are typical of indoor air volatile organic compound (VOC) levels, such conditions have been poorly investigated to date. Decane conversion rates higher than 90% were reached within 15 h for the highest initial concentration tested in the operating conditions used. Despite this high decane conversion, 18 reaction intermediates were detected in the gas phase. The main compounds, in terms of concentration level in the gas phase, were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and propanal. The amounts of these compounds in the gas phase were linearly dependent on the initial decane concentration. A reaction pathway is proposed, based on reaction intermediate temporal profiles and the literature. It consists of six main steps describing the oxidation process from decane to CO and CO<inf>2</inf>. The influence of the relative humidity level on the diversity and amounts of reaction intermediates was also studied. It was shown that moisture tends to shift the equilibrium of intermediates adsorption toward desorption, resulting in a relative increase in intermediate quantities in the gas phase. However, the monitoring of CO and CO<inf>2</inf> formation highlighted that, at the end of the reaction, a high mineralization rate could be obtained. Finally, an overview of the photocatalytic reaction is given through the carbon mass balance determined for various reaction advancements. This approach gives an overall evaluation of the photocatalytic process performance, from primary compound removal to reaction intermediate and mineralization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Their properties were characterized by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectra and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). Independently of which catalyst was used, ethanol was more easily oxidized than toluene. In toluene oxidation, the sequence of catalytic activity was as follows: Pt/Mn/B > Pt/B > Mn/B, probably due to some favorable synergetic effects between Pt and Mn and to the presence of Mn3+/Mn4+ species. In ethanol oxidation, Pt/Mn/B and Pt/B present similar activities, and greater than that of Mn/B. In the VOC mixture, toluene slows down the partial oxidation of ethanol towards acetaldehyde. On the contrary, the presence of ethanol has a promoting effect on toluene oxidation. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bentonite; Mno X; Pt; Vocs Mixtures; Brunauer-emmett-teller Method; Mno; Monolithic Catalysts; Partial Oxidation Of Ethanol; Temperature-programmed Reduction; Toluene Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compound Removals; X Ray Photoelectron Spectra; Bentonite; Catalysts; Catalytic Oxidation; Ethanol; Manganese Oxide; Mixtures; Oxidation; Platinum; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; X Ray Diffraction; X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy; Manganese","Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method; MnO; Monolithic catalysts; Partial oxidation of ethanol; Temperature-programmed reduction; Toluene oxidation; Volatile organic compound removals; X ray photoelectron spectra; Bentonite; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Ethanol; Manganese oxide; Mixtures; Oxidation; Platinum; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Manganese","","","","Catalytica Environmental Report no E4, (1993); Spivey, James Jerry, Complete Catalytic Oxidation of Volatile Organics, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 26, 11, pp. 2165-2180, (1987); Añón, J.

Recently, first products appeared on the market using zeolites also for improving the indoor air quality so far volatile organic compounds (VOC) are concerned. However, porous compounds like zeolites can be found also in plaster material. Therefore, it was manifest to evaluate the capability of plaster with regard to air cleaning. In this article, the contribution of plaster compounds toward adsorption and catalytical decomposition of VOCs is evaluated using α-pinene, chlorobenzene, 2-ethoxyethylacetate, and pentanal as target substances under standard conditions (23°C, 50%r.H.). These compounds were chosen because of their VOC typical physicochemical properties like molecular dimensions, density, boiling point, vapor pressure, and octanol-water distribution coefficient (logk<inf>ow</inf>). Hydrated lime and metakaolin were found out to have good adsorption properties under these circumstances. Also natural zeolites showed good results especially on pentanal. By investigations in environmental chambers the reduction potential of test plasters on chlorobenzene and 2-ethoxyethylacetate concentrations could be shown. Application of coatings had no or only temporary influence on the performance of the plaster. Additional tests in small chambers demonstrated the possibility to improve the properties of plasters with help of FAU- or MFI-type zeolites but the experiments also showed that α-pinene and pentanal undergo chemical reactions. Further effort should be made on investigations also toward other compounds, especially more volatile ones like formaldehyde. Also additional building materials like insulation material or boards should be taken into account. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This mode was based on confining the biocatalytic activity exclusively in the non-aqueous phase (NAP) by using hydrophobic microorganisms. The TLPB was implemented in a 2.5L stirred tank reactor using 10% (v/v) of silicone oil as NAP and hexane as model VOC. A stable elimination capacity (EC) of 21.0±2.5gm-3h-1 (corresponding to a removal efficiency of 80%) was recorded for 26 days. The accumulation of inhibitory metabolites resulted in drastic drops in the elimination capacity (EC) and an unstable performance of the system, hexanol being identified as potential inhibitory metabolite. Aqueous culture broth exchange by fresh mineral salt medium at a dilution rate of 0.2day-1 allowed maintaining a high and sustained VOC removal performance.

This paper reviews the last two decades' publications on organic vapour emissions from food processing, their sources, impacts and treatment methods. An overview of the latest developments in conventional air treatment methods is presented, followed by the main focus of the paper, non-thermal plasma technology. The results of the review suggest that non-thermal plasma technology, in its pulsed corona discharge configuration, is an emerging treatment method with potential for low-cost, effective abatement of a wide spectrum of organic air pollutants. It is found that the combination of plasma treatment with catalysis is a development trend that demonstrates considerable potential. The as yet relatively small number of plasma treatment applications is considered to be due to the novelty of pulsed electric discharge techniques and a lack of reliable pulse generators and reactors. Other issues acting as barriers to widespread adoption of the technique include the possible formation of stable oxidation by-products, residual ozone and nitrogen oxides, and sensitivity towards air humidity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysis; Food Industry; Non-thermal Plasma; Oxidation; Review Article; Vocs; 2 Propanol; Acetaldehyde; Acetic Acid Ethyl Ester; Acetone; Alcohol; Ammonia; Cyclohexanone; Cysteine; Formaldehyde; Hexane; Lipid; Methionine; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Oxide; Propane; Propanol; Styrene; Sulfur; Thiophene; Toluene; Electric Corona; Food Processing; Nitrogen Oxides; Nitrogen Plasma; Plasma Applications; Volatile Organic Compounds; Development And Applications; Discharge Plasma; Food Industries; Nonthermal Plasma; Plasma Methods; Plasma Technology; Plasma Treatment; Review Article; Treatment Methods; Volatile Organic Compound Emission; Catalysis; 1,2 Dicarbonyl Derivative; 2 Propanol; Acetaldehyde; Acetic Acid Ethyl Ester; Acetone; Alcohol; Aliphatic Hydrocarbon; Ammonia; Bleaching Agent; Chlorinated Hydrocarbon; Cyclohexanone; Cysteine; Disinfectant Agent; Formaldehyde; Hexane; Lipid; Methionine; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Oxide; Propane; Propanol; Styrene; Sugar; Sulfur; Thiol; Thiophene; Toluene; Unindexed Drug; Unsaturated Fatty Acid; Volatile Organic Compound; Abatement Cost; Atmospheric Pollution; Catalysis; Cost-benefit Analysis; Electrical Power; Emission Control; Food Industry; Industrial Emission; Literature Review; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Plasma; Absorption; Adsorption; Aerosol; Air Pollutant; Biofiltration; Combustion; Decarboxylation; Dielectric Barrier Discharge; Electrical Parameters; Electron Beam; Filtration; Food Processing; Generator; Heating; Humidity; Low Temperature; Microbial Activity; Microbial Degradation; Non Thermal Plasma Technology; Oxidation; Photocatalysis; Pyrolysis; Reactor; Reduction; Review; Sea Food; Smoking; Technology; Water Vapor","Electric corona; Food processing; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen plasma; Plasma applications; Volatile organic compounds; Development and applications; Discharge plasma; Food industries; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma methods; Plasma technology; Plasma treatment; Review article; Treatment methods; Volatile organic compound emission; Catalysis; 1,2 dicarbonyl derivative; 2 propanol; acetaldehyde; acetic acid ethyl ester; acetone; alcohol; aliphatic hydrocarbon; ammonia; bleaching agent; chlorinated hydrocarbon; cyclohexanone; cysteine; disinfectant agent; formaldehyde; hexane; lipid; methionine; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; propane; propanol; styrene; sugar; sulfur; thiol; thiophene; toluene; unindexed drug; unsaturated fatty acid; volatile organic compound; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; catalysis; cost-benefit analysis; electrical power; emission control; food industry; industrial emission; literature review; nitrogen oxides; ozone; plasma; absorption; adsorption; aerosol; air pollutant; biofiltration; combustion; decarboxylation; dielectric barrier discharge; electrical parameters; electron beam; filtration; food processing; generator; heating; humidity; low temperature; microbial activity; microbial degradation; non thermal plasma technology; oxidation; photocatalysis; pyrolysis; reactor; reduction; review; sea food; smoking; technology; water vapor","","2 propanol, 67-63-0; acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; acetic acid ethyl ester, 141-78-6; acetone, 67-64-1; alcohol, 64-17-5; ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; cyclohexanone, 108-94-1; cysteine, 4371-52-2, 52-89-1, 52-90-4; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; hexane, 110-54-3; lipid, 66455-18-3; methionine, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; propane, 74-98-6; propanol, 62309-51-7, 71-23-8; styrene, 100-42-5; sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9; thiophene, 110-02-1; toluene, 108-88-3","The financial support of EXAIRDEC project (grant agreement no. 243632-2 ), funded by the European Commission FP7-SME-2008-2 programme, is gratefully appreciated.","Aguado, Sonia, Use of zeolite membrane reactors for the combustion of VOCs present in air at low concentrations, Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 83, 3 A, pp. 295-301, (2005); Añón, J.

Toluene, a typical toxic volatile organic compound, was oxidized through a fixed bed reaction chamber containing zeolitesupported copper oxide (CuO/zeolite) catalyst mixed with silicon carbide (SiC), an excellent microwave-absorbing material. The target compound was efficiently degraded on the surface of the catalyst at high reaction temperature achieved by microwave-heated SiC. A set of experimental parameters, such as microwave power, air flow and the loading size of CuO etc., were investigated, respectively. The study demonstrated these parameters had critical impact on toluene degradation. Under optimal condition, 92% toluene was removed by this combined process, corresponding to an 80%-90% TOC removal rate. Furthermore, the catalyst was highly stable even after eight consecutive 6-h runs. At last, a hypothetical degradation pathway of toluene was proposed based on the experimental data obtained from gas chromatographymass spectrum and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Oxidation; Cuo/zeolite Catalyst; Microwave; Silicon Carbide (sic); Toluene","","","","Acknowledgements This research was funded by the program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) (No. IRT0853).

The legal regulations introduced by the European Union governing the assessment and management of air quality obliges member states to systematically reduce BTEX emissions into the atmosphere, and hence to monitor and then remove these compounds from contaminated gaseous media. Recent years have witnessed the ongoing search for new and improved techniques for removing BTEX compounds from waste gases. The authors describe the destruction techniques commonly used for treating waste gases, focusing on the ever more popular biological methods (with their modifications) and the well-established techniques utilizing oxidation. They focused on discussing both advantages and drawbacks of presented techniques.

In general, the total bacteria concentration was found to vary from 60 to >52,560 colony-forming units (CFU)/m3, and the total fungi concentration ranged from 369 to 14,068 CFU/m3. Generally, Gram-positive bacteria were observed in higher number than Gram-negative bacteria. CO<inf>2</inf> concentration ranged from 251 to 9,710 ppm, and CO concentration was either not detected or presented a level of 1 ppm. H <inf>2</inf>S concentration ranged from 0.1 to 6.0 ppm. NH<inf>3</inf> concentration was <2 ppm in most samples. Formaldehyde was <0.01 ppm at all sampling sites. The total VOC concentration ranged from 36 to 1,724 μg/m3. Among the VOCs, toluene presented the highest concentration. Results point to indoor/outdoor ratios higher than one. In general, the highest levels of airborne contaminants were detected at the primary treatment (SEDIPAC 3D), secondary sedimentation, and sludge dehydration. At most sampling sites, the concentrations of airborne contaminants were below the occupational exposure limits (OELs) for all the campaigns. However, a few contaminants were above OELs in some sampling sites. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Bioaerosols; Indoor Airborne; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Formaldehyde; Hydrogen Sulfide; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Formaldehyde; Hydrogen Sulfide; Volatile Organic Compounds; Airborne Contaminants; Airborne Contamination; Bacteria Concentrations; Bioaerosols; Co Concentrations; Colony Forming Units; Gram-negative Bacteria; Gram-positive Bacterium; Indoor Air; Indoor Airborne; Indoor/outdoor; Occupational Exposure Limits; Primary Treatment; Sampling Site; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Formaldehyde; Fungi; Hydrogen Sulfide; Indoor Air Pollution; Sewage Pumping Plants; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Treatment Plants; Contamination; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Formaldehyde; Hydrogen Sulfide; Volatile Organic Compound; Aerosol; Atmospheric Pollution; Concentration (composition); Environmental Assessment; Indoor Air; Waste Facility; Waste Treatment; Wastewater; Water Treatment; Air Temperature; Article; Bacterium Contamination; Bacterium Detection; Concentration (parameters); Fungal Contamination; Fungal Detection; Humidity; Indoor Air Pollution; Nonhuman; Quantitative Analysis; Waste Water Treatment Plant; Air Microbiology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Occupational Exposure; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Posibacteria","Airborne contaminants; Airborne contamination; Bacteria concentrations; Bioaerosols; CO concentrations; Colony forming units; Gram-negative bacteria; Gram-positive bacterium; Indoor air; Indoor airborne; Indoor/outdoor; Occupational Exposure Limits; Primary treatment; Sampling site; Wastewater treatment plants; Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Formaldehyde; Fungi; Hydrogen sulfide; Indoor air pollution; Sewage pumping plants; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Water treatment plants; Contamination; ammonia; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; formaldehyde; hydrogen sulfide; volatile organic compound; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental assessment; indoor air; waste facility; waste treatment; wastewater; water treatment; air temperature; article; bacterium contamination; bacterium detection; concentration (parameters); fungal contamination; fungal detection; humidity; indoor air pollution; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; waste water treatment plant; Air Microbiology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Ammonia; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Occupational Exposure; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Posibacteria","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; hydrogen sulfide, 15035-72-0, 7783-06-4; Air Pollutants, 0; Ammonia, 7664-41-7; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbon Monoxide, 630-08-0; Formaldehyde, 50-00-0; Hydrogen Sulfide, 7783-06-4; Volatile Organic Compounds, 0","Acknowledgments Financial support for this work was provided by a FCT project (PTDC/EQU-EQU/100554/2008) and by project PEst-C/EQB/LA0020/2011, financed by FEDER through COMPETE\u2013Programa Operacional Factores de Com-petitividade and by FCT\u2013Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnolo-gia for which the authors are thankful.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a promising technology for air pollution control. In this study, the AOP photo-Fenton oxidative reaction in the liquid phase was applied to chemical absorption and degradation of toluene in waste gas. RESULTS: For toluene levels of 0.25 mg L-1 in waste gas flowing at 5.0 Lmin-1 the maximum removal and mineralization of toluene in the waste gas were more than 90% with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> dosage above 150 mg L-1 and Fe dosage above 10 mg L-1. The Toluene photodegradation efficiency increased with increasing dosages of Fenton reagents, however, beyond a certain dosage further improvements were insignificant. The photo-Fenton reaction in the liquid-phase could improve the overall toluene absorption rate by increasing the driving force for mass transfer and as a result enhance the removal of toluene from exhaust gas. CONCLUSION: Toluene in waste gas was successfully removed and mineralized by the photo-Fenton process. The mineralization of toluene was strongly linked with the iron redox cycle and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decomposition driven by the Fenton reagents and UV light. The proposed chemical absorption process based on photo-Fenton photocatalytic oxidation in the liquid phase was shown to be very effective for the degradation of VOCs in waste gas. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bubble Column Photoreactor; Chemical Absorption; Photo-fenton Degradation; Toluene Gas; Vocs Removal; Hydrogen Peroxide; Toluene; Bubble Columns; Degradation; Gases; Liquids; Mineralogy; Photodegradation; Redox Reactions; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Absorption Rates; Advanced Oxidation Process; Chemical Absorption; Driving Forces; Fenton Reagents; Industrial Area; Liquid Phase; Oxidative Reaction; Photo-fenton; Photo-fenton Degradation; Photo-fenton Process; Photo-fenton Reactions; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Photodegradation Efficiency; Photoreactors; Redox Cycles; Treatment Process; Vocs Removal; Waste Gas; Gas Absorption; Hydrogen Peroxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Aerobic Metabolism; Article; Bubble Column Reactor; Exhaust Gas; Fenton Reaction; Gas Waste; Metabolism; Mineralization; Photodegradation; Waste Component Removal","Bubble columns; Degradation; Gases; Liquids; Mineralogy; Photodegradation; Redox reactions; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Absorption rates; Advanced oxidation process; Chemical absorption; Driving forces; Fenton reagents; Industrial area; Liquid Phase; Oxidative reaction; Photo-Fenton; Photo-fenton degradation; Photo-Fenton process; Photo-Fenton reactions; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photodegradation efficiency; Photoreactors; REDOX cycles; Treatment process; VOCs removal; Waste gas; Gas absorption; hydrogen peroxide; toluene; volatile organic compound; aerobic metabolism; article; bubble column reactor; exhaust gas; Fenton reaction; gas waste; metabolism; mineralization; photodegradation; waste component removal","","hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; toluene, 108-88-3","","Air Pollution Control Engineering, (2004); Añón, J.

The adsorption process was found to be rapid (equilibrium capacity achieved within 5 minutes) with low adsorptive capacity (of the order of 0.4 mg g-1) when compared with activated carbon. Electrochemical regeneration of the Nyex 1000 in a simple divided electrochemical cell within a sequential batch treatment unit restored 100% of the adsorbent's adsorptive capacity using treatment times as low as 20 minutes by passing a current of 0.5 A. The sorptive characteristics of a Nyex-water slurry were also modelled and investigated both in a bubble column and in a continuous adsorption-regeneration treatment system. It was demonstrated that the continuous removal-destruction system could achieve a step reduction in challenge gas concentration of approximately 75% for a period of 35 minutes with a current of 5 Amps. This was attributed to mass transfer enhanced by a combination of adsorption and chemical reaction with free chlorine species generated in the electrochemical process. © IWA Publishing 2012. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Adsorption; Electrochemical Regeneration; Mercaptans; Nyex; Activated Carbon; Chlorine; Thiol Derivative; Air Pollutants; Charcoal; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Adsorption Process; Adsorptive Capacity; Carbon Based Adsorbents; Electrochemical Process; Electrochemical Regeneration; Free Chlorine; Gas Concentration; Gas Streams; Mercaptans; Nyex; Sequential Batch; Treatment Systems; Treatment Time; Treatment Units; Activated Carbon; Activated Carbon Treatment; Bubble Columns; Chlorine; Adsorption; Activated Carbon; Adsorbent; Chlorine; Nyex 1000; Thiol Derivative; Unclassified Drug; Adsorption; Aqueous Solution; Electrokinesis; Pollutant Removal; Agricultural Slurry; Article; Batch Reactor; Electrochemistry; Isotherm; Particle Size; Porosity; Surface Property; Air Pollutants; Charcoal; Electrochemistry; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Adsorption process; Adsorptive capacity; Carbon based adsorbents; Electrochemical process; Electrochemical regeneration; Free chlorine; Gas concentration; Gas streams; Mercaptans; Nyex; Sequential batch; Treatment systems; Treatment time; Treatment units; Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Bubble columns; Chlorine; Adsorption; activated carbon; adsorbent; chlorine; Nyex 1000; thiol derivative; unclassified drug; adsorption; aqueous solution; electrokinesis; pollutant removal; agricultural slurry; article; batch reactor; electrochemistry; isotherm; particle size; porosity; surface property; Air Pollutants; Charcoal; Electrochemistry; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","activated carbon, 64365-11-3, 82228-96-4; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; thiol derivative, 13940-21-1; Air Pollutants, 0; Charcoal, 16291-96-6; Sulfhydryl Compounds, 0; Water Pollutants, Chemical, 0","","Bagastyo, Arseto Y., Electrochemical oxidation of reverse osmosis concentrate on mixed metal oxide (MMO) titanium coated electrodes, Water Research, 45, 16, pp. 4951-4959, (2011); Brown, Nigel Willis, Electrochemical pre-treatment of effluents containing chlorinated compounds using an adsorbent, Journal of Applied Electrochemistry, 37, 11, pp. 1329-1335, (2007); Brown, Nigel Willis, Atrazine removal using adsorption and electrochemical regeneration, Water Research, 38, 13, pp. 3067-3074, (2004); Brown, Nigel Willis, Electrochemical regeneration of a carbon-based adsorbent loaded with crystal violet dye, Electrochimica Acta, 49, 20, pp. 3269-3281, (2004); Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment Management Systems in the Chemical Sector, (2003); Faujour, C., A comparison of action of chlorine and ozone on malodorous organic products: The particular case of incondensible gases resulting from rendering of carcasses, Ozone: Science and Engineering, 2, 3, pp. 261-282, (1980); Iranpour, Reza, Literature review of air pollution control biofilters and biotrickling filters for odor and volatile organic compound removal, Environmental Progress, 24, 3, pp. 254-267, (2005); Trace Constituents in Landfill Gas, (1988); Misic, Dragoslav M., Adsorption of Benzene in Carbon Slurries, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Fundamentals, 10, 3, pp. 380-389, (1971); Nyex 1000 Characterisation, (2010)","","","","","","","","02731223; 19969732","9781843395843; 0080336590; 0080310362; 9781843395959; 9781843396000; 9780080336695; 0080290930; 9781843391883; 0080304362; 9781843391487","WSTED","22925855","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870362189"

Among various molecular contaminants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are an important class of contaminants that need purification. Therefore, catalytic removal of VOCs (using a catalytic reactor) from cabin air is of utmost importance. Weight and volume of the catalytic reactors are important factors to be considered. Furthermore, the catalytic reactors should be able to operate at high face velocity of the jet engine bleed air. Catalyst-coated-monolith and packed-bed reactors are intended for this purpose but they were originally developed for different operating conditions. These current techniques result high pressure drop, and low fluid-solid mass transfer rate at such high face velocity and operating temperature. A unique class of composite material, microfibrous entrapped catalyst (MFEC), prepared by traditional low cost paper making technique, can entrap small catalyst particulates into sinter-locked networks of metal microfibers. These materials can be tailored to high and variable voidage, and are in the form of thin flexible sheets which have the ability of pleating. MFEC with the pleated configuration (Number of pleat 4) exhibits significant reduction in pressure drop, and higher catalyst utilization. Also, entrapped small particles in MFEC enhance interphase and intra-particle mass transfer rates. Catalytic oxidation of n-hexane (a model VOC), in a prototype aircraft cabin catalytic converter, was investigated at typical face velocities (from 10 to 30 m/s). This high face velocity resulted intra-bed/intra-layer residence times from 350 μsec to 115 μsec. This paper discusses the performance of MFEC for VOC removal from aircraft cabins in terms of pressure drop and oxidation at short contact time. Results of this study have shown significant improvement in overall system performance. Catalyst characterization and detailed reaction kinetics will be discussed using the experimental findings. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Typically, an incinerator of urban solid waste produces large flows of hot gaseous emissions to be purified before being released into the atmosphere. In this paper, treatments of flue gas from a typical municipal waste incinerator are described. The first step is an energy recovery system through heat exchangers to make steam or hot water. Steam is used to produce electricity via a turbine. The economic balance of the total system is very often dependent on the heat recovery. The second step involves particle removal technologies. Different systems are available such as cyclones, scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators or baghouse filters. The third step is the removal of numerous molecule families such as acid compounds (SO<inf>x</inf>, HCl, HF), nitrogen oxides (NO<inf>x</inf>), metal species and many organic compounds. The latter include dioxins, furans and volatile organic compounds. Some treatment processes are described according to the pollutant family. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acid Gas; Gas Treatments; Incinerator; Nox; Particle Removal; Sox; Volatile Organic Compounds (voc)","","","","","European Patent EP, (1995); Abanades, Stéphane, Development of an inverse method to identify the kinetics of heavy metal release during waste incineration in fluidized bed, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 124, 1-3, pp. 19-26, (2005); Material Flows and Investment Costs of Flue Gas Cleaning Systems of Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators in University of California Irvine Incineration and Thermal Treatment Technologies, (2000); Dechets Municipaux Chiffres Cles, (2008); Bergsdal, Håvard, Environmental assessment of two waste incineration strategies for Central Norway, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 10, 4, pp. 263-272, (2005); Les Polluants Et Les Techniques D Epuration De Fumees, (1998); Organohal Comp, (1994); Air Filtration an Integrated Approach to the Theory and Applications of Fibrous Filters, (1993); Buekens, Alfons G., Comparative evaluation of techniques for controlling the formation and emission of chlorinated dioxins/furans in municipal waste incineration, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 62, 1, pp. 1-33, (1998); Buonanno, Giorgio, Size distribution and number concentration of particles at the stack of a municipal waste incinerator, Waste Management, 29, 2, pp. 749-755, (2009)","","","","","","","","15729826; 15691705","","RESBC","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869878918"

Biotrickling filters employing synthetic, inorganic media yield more uniform gas distribution and biological contact. Hydrophilic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are easily degradable while hydrophobic ones pose a great challenge for adequate treatment due to the transfer of the VOC to the liquid phase. This chapter will review the current status of biotechnology treatment.

BTF's performance and metabolic activity of biofilm were investigated within the long-term operation period. BTF could remove more than 80% of VOCs mixture under the conditions of < 910 mg/m3 inlet concentrations. Therefore, BTF could treat low-and moderate-concentration waste gases containing toluene, methanol and ethyl acrylate efficiently and simultaneously. The overall elimination capacity reached 100 g/(m3·h) at inlet loads of 120 g/(m3·h). The mass ratio of carbon dioxide produced to VOCs removed was approximately 1.731, indicating complete degradation of VOCs mixtures. The degradation of toluene, methanol and ethyl acrylate in the BTF followed Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. The maximum specific degradation rate (r<inf>max</inf>) was 90.9, 50.5 and 58.5 g/(m3·h), respectively.

Method: To achieve this objective, it was necessary to design standardized test benches and protocols to assess photocatalytic efficiency of materials or systems used in the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and odour under conditions close to applications. The tests are based on the validation of robust analytical methods at the parts per billion by volume level that not only follow the disappearance of the initial VOCs but also identify the secondary species and calculate the mineralization rates. Results: The first results of inter-laboratory closed chamber tests, according to XP B44-013 AFNOR standard, are described. The photocatalytic degradation of mixtures of several defined pollutants under controlled conditions (temperature, relative humidity, initial concentration) was carried out in two independent laboratories with the same photocatalytic device and with various analytical procedures. Comparison of the degradation rate and of the mineralization efficiency allowed the determination of the clean air delivery rate in both cases. Formaldehyde was the only by-product detected during photocatalytic test under standardized experimental conditions. The concentration of transient formaldehyde varied according to the initial VOC concentration. Moreover the photocatalytic reaction rate of formaldehyde in mixture with other pollutants was analysed. It was concluded that formaldehyde concentration did not increase with time. Conclusion-perspective: This type of experiment should allow the comparison of the performances of different photoreactors and of photocatalytic media under controlled and reproducible conditions against mixtures of pollutants including formaldehyde. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Analytical Procedures; Formaldehyde; Mineralization; Organic Volatile Compounds (voc); Photocatalysis; Standard; Formaldehyde; Air Pollutants; Formaldehyde; Volatile Organic Compounds; Formaldehyde; Volatile Organic Compound; Atmospheric Pollution; Catalysis; Efficiency Measurement; Indoor Air; Mineralization; Odor; Performance Assessment; Photochemistry; Photodegradation; Pollutant Removal; Reaction Rate; Standard (reference); Testing Method; Air Pollutant; Article; Chemistry; Ecosystem Restoration; Environmental Monitoring; Indoor Air Pollution; Instrumentation; Methodology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Remediation; Formaldehyde; Photochemical Processes; Volatile Organic Compounds","formaldehyde; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; catalysis; efficiency measurement; indoor air; mineralization; odor; performance assessment; photochemistry; photodegradation; pollutant removal; reaction rate; standard (reference); testing method; air pollutant; article; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; environmental monitoring; indoor air pollution; instrumentation; methodology; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Remediation; Formaldehyde; Photochemical Processes; Volatile Organic Compounds","","formaldehyde, 50-00-0; Air Pollutants, 0; Formaldehyde, 50-00-0; Volatile Organic Compounds, 0","Acknowledgement The authors acknowledge the Ministère de l’éco-nomie et de l’emploi, Direction Générale Compétitivité Industrie et Services (DGCIS), Région Rhône-Alpes, Conseil Général de l’Isère, Conseil Général de l’Ain for funding this study in the NORMACAT project, labelled by the Axelera cluster.","Methode D Essais Et D Analyse Pour La Mesure D Efficacite De Systemes Photocatalytiques Pour L Elimination Des Composes Organiques Volatiles Odeurs Dans L Air Interieur En Recirculation Test En Enceinte Confinee, (2009); Bibliography of Work on the Photocatalytic Removal of Hazardous Compounds from Water and Air, (2001); Reduced Energy Use Through Reduced Indoor Contamination in Residential Buildings, (2006); Removal of Indoor Air Ppb Level Volatile Organic Compounds Vocs and Nox by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis, (2002); Jo, Wan-kuen, Photocatalytic destruction of VOCs for in-vehicle air cleaning, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, 148, 1-3, pp. 109-119, (2002); Les Pollutions Dans L Air Interieur Des Batiments Diagnostic, (2000); Les Composes Organiques Volatils Cov Dans L Environnement, (1998); Mol Supramol Photochem Semicond Photochem Photophys, (2003); Obee, Timothy N., Photooxidation of sub-parts-per-million toluene and formaldehyde levels on titania using a glass-plate reactor, Environmental Science and Technology, 30, 12, pp. 3578-3584, (1996); Pichat, Pierre, Purification/deodorization of indoor air and gaseous effluents by TiO2 photocatalysis, Catalysis Today, 63, 2-4, pp. 363-369, (2000)","","","","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","ESPLE","23054738","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867093502"

Of particular concern is fugitive odours emitted from the handling and use of refinery condensate streams, particularly the digestion condensate. This study evaluated the application of using catalytic ozonation to treat alumina refinery condensate in order to remove the potential emission of odourous compounds from the industrial wastewater. The technical challenges in treating the alumina refinery condensate are the high pH and temperatures of the wastewater effluent (over 80°C and pH above 10) due the industrial process. The odour removal efficiencies for different catalysts (FeCl<inf>3</inf>, MnO, and MnSO<inf>4</inf>) under experimental conditions in terms of controlled pH, temperature and ozone dosage were determined before and after ozone treatment using dynamic olfactometry. The result demonstrated that the addition of both FeCl<inf>3</inf> and MnO catalysts improved odour removal efficiencies during the ozonation of alumina condensates at similar pH and temperature conditions. FeCl<inf>3</inf> and MnO had similar enhancement for odour removal, however MnO was determined to be more appropriate than MnSO<inf>4</inf> for odour removal due to the colouration of the treated condensate. © IWA Publishing 2012. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Condensate; Odour Treatment; Odourous Emission; Odours; Ozonation; Aluminum Oxide; Ferrous Chloride; Manganese Oxide; Manganese Sulfate; Aluminum Oxide; Ozone; Alumina Refineries; Aluminium Processing; Catalytic Ozonation; Condensate; Dynamic Olfactometry; Experimental Conditions; High Ph; High Temperature; Industrial Processs; Industrial Wastewaters; Local Community; Odour Emissions; Ozone Treatment; Removal Efficiencies; Technical Challenges; Temperature Conditions; Wastewater Effluents; Alumina; Aluminum; Catalysts; Effluents; Industrial Water Treatment; Manganese Oxide; Odors; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Refining; Wastewater Treatment; Ozone; Aluminum Oxide; Ferrous Chloride; Manganese Oxide; Manganese Sulfate; Catalysis; Condensate; Digestion; High Temperature; Industrial Waste; Odor; Ozone; Ph; Pollutant Removal; Refining Industry; Alumina Refinery Condensate; Article; Gas Waste; Odor Control; Olfactometry; Ozonation; Ozone Therapy; Temperature; Waste Water Management; Aluminum Oxide; Temperature; Water Purification","Alumina refineries; Aluminium processing; Catalytic ozonation; Condensate; Dynamic olfactometry; Experimental conditions; High pH; High temperature; Industrial processs; Industrial wastewaters; Local community; Odour emissions; Ozone treatment; Removal efficiencies; Technical challenges; Temperature conditions; Wastewater effluents; Alumina; Aluminum; Catalysts; Effluents; Industrial water treatment; Manganese oxide; Odors; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Refining; Wastewater treatment; Ozone; aluminum oxide; ferrous chloride; manganese oxide; manganese sulfate; catalysis; condensate; digestion; high temperature; industrial waste; odor; ozone; pH; pollutant removal; refining industry; alumina refinery condensate; article; gas waste; odor control; olfactometry; ozonation; ozone therapy; temperature; waste water management; Aluminum Oxide; Temperature; Water Purification","","aluminum oxide, 1302-74-5, 1318-23-6, 1344-28-1, 14762-49-3; ferrous chloride, 12040-57-2, 7758-94-3; manganese oxide, 11129-60-5, 1317-35-7; manganese sulfate, 10124-55-7, 7785-87-7; Aluminum Oxide, 1344-28-1; Ozone, 10028-15-6","","Andreozzi, Roberto, The use of manganese dioxide as a heterogeneous catalyst for oxalic acid ozonation in aqueous solution, Applied Catalysis A: General, 138, 1, pp. 75-81, (1996); Andreozzi, Roberto, Kinetic modeling of pyruvic acid ozonation in aqueous solutions catalyzed by Mn(II) and Mn(IV) ions, Water Research, 35, 1, pp. 109-120, (2001); Stationary Source Emissions Part 3 Determination of Odour Concentration by Dynamic Olfactometry, (2001); Beltrán Novillo, Fernando J., Industrial wastewater advanced oxidation.

Electro-reactor and normal pulse voltammetry results showed that the removal of H<inf>2</inf>S (95%) proceeded via mediated electrocatalytic oxidation. An increase in the total acidity of the anolyte solution suggested that SO42- could be the final product. Experiments were optimized using different reaction conditions, such as, by changing H<inf>2</inf>S loading, active Co(III) concentration, and hydrogen sulfide flow rates. At a high active Co(III) concentration (0.066M) and a low H<inf>2</inf>S flow rate (10Lmin-1), H<inf>2</inf>S removal was favorable at 10°C.

Recently, the process was combined with scrubbing technology to allow the effective treatment of industrial air pollution. This review focuses on the development and applications of the MEO-assisted scrubbing process for the treatment of environmental air pollution. Particular focus was given to MEO using metal ions as mediators, influencing factors, such as electrolytes, electrode, flow method and rate, and the scrubbing column. More than 200 related publications were reviewed with 174 cited. Electro-scrubbing is considered as an advanced technology with possible further developments. Active electrodes, such as titanium-based Pt, DSA(RuO <inf>2</inf>/IrO <inf>2</inf>) film electrodes result in the complete mineralization of air pollutants in the MEO process. Air pollutants are removed with the assistance of electrogenerated high energy metal ions, such as Ag(II), Co(III) and Ce(IV), as well as by ozone and chlorine, as mediators in an acidic medium. © 2012 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollutants; Electro-oxidation; Electrochemically Assisted-scrubbing; Meo; Scrubber; Acidic Mediums; Active Electrodes; Advanced Technology; Air Pollutants; Electro-catalytic Oxidation; Electrochemically Assisted-scrubbing; Environmental Air Pollution; Film Electrodes; Further Development; High Energy; Influencing Factor; Meo; Titanium-based; Chlorine; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Metal Ions; Ozone; Platinum; Ruthenium Compounds; Scrubbers; Titanium; Air Pollution","Acidic mediums; Active electrodes; Advanced technology; Air pollutants; Electro-catalytic oxidation; Electrochemically assisted-scrubbing; Environmental air pollution; Film electrodes; Further development; High energy; Influencing factor; MEO; Titanium-based; Chlorine; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Metal ions; Ozone; Platinum; Ruthenium compounds; Scrubbers; Titanium; Air pollution","","","This study was supported by several funding agencies: the Korean Ministry of the Environment through “The Eco-technopia 21 project”, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) through the Regional Innovation Centre (RIC) project, a Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD, KRF-2007-D00001 ), and a Korea Research Foundation and Korean Federation of Science and Technology Society Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD, Basic Research Promotion Fund ).","Bousher, Andrew, Removal of coloured organic matter by adsorption onto low-cost waste materials, Water Research, 31, 8, pp. 2084-2092, (1997); Rajeshwar’, Krishnan, Electrochemistry and the environment, Journal of Applied Electrochemistry, 24, 11, pp. 1077-1091, (1994); Industrial Electrochemistry, (1990); Grimm, J.

Recently, absorption and biodegradation coupling in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) proved to be a promising technology for hydrophobic compound treatment. The choice of the organic phase, the non-Aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) is based on various parameters involved in both steps of the process, hydrophobic VOC absorption in a gas-liquid contactor, and biodegradation in the TPPB. VOC solubility and diffusivity in the selected NAPL, as well as NAPL viscosity, seems to be the main parameters during the absorption step, while biocompatibility, namely the absence of toxic effect of the NAPL towards microorganisms, non-biodegradability and VOC partition coefficient between NAPL and water were revealed as the key factors during the biodegradation step. The screening of the various NAPL available in the literature highlighted two families of compounds matching the required conditions for the proposed integrated process, silicone oils and ionic liquids. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Absorption; Hydrophobic Voc; Ionic Liquids; Non-aqueous Phase Liquid; Silicone Oils; Twophase Partitioning Bioreactor; Benzene; Dimethyl Disulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Ethylbenzene; Meta Xylene; Ortho Xylene; Para Xylene; Toluene; Gas-liquid Contactors; Hydrophobic Compounds; Hydrophobic Voc; Integrated Process; Main Parameters; Nonaqueous Phase Liquids; Organic Liquid; Organic Phase; Partition Coefficient; Silicone Oil; Toxic Effect; Two Phase Partitioning Bioreactor; Absorption; Biocompatibility; Biological Water Treatment; Bioreactors; Hydrophobicity; Ionic Liquids; Microbiology; Silicones; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Absorption; Biodegradation; Benzene; Dimethyl Disulfide; Dimethyl Sulfide; Ethylbenzene; Meta Xylene; Ortho Xylene; Para Xylene; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compound; Absorption; Biodegradation; Bioreactor; Diffusivity; Hydrophobicity; Microorganism; Nonaqueous Phase Liquid; Partition Coefficient; Solubility; Viscosity; Article; Diffusion Coefficient; Liquid; Non Aqueous Phase Liquid; Nonhuman; Physical Chemistry; Two Phase Partitioning Bioreactor; Waste Component Removal","Gas-liquid contactors; Hydrophobic compounds; Hydrophobic voc; Integrated process; Main parameters; Nonaqueous phase liquids; Organic liquid; Organic phase; Partition coefficient; Silicone oil; Toxic effect; Two phase partitioning bioreactor; Absorption; Biocompatibility; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Hydrophobicity; Ionic liquids; Microbiology; Silicones; Volatile organic compounds; Water absorption; Biodegradation; benzene; dimethyl disulfide; dimethyl sulfide; ethylbenzene; meta xylene; ortho xylene; para xylene; toluene; volatile organic compound; absorption; biodegradation; bioreactor; diffusivity; hydrophobicity; microorganism; nonaqueous phase liquid; partition coefficient; solubility; viscosity; article; diffusion coefficient; liquid; non aqueous phase liquid; nonhuman; physical chemistry; two phase partitioning bioreactor; waste component removal","","benzene, 71-43-2; dimethyl disulfide, 624-92-0; dimethyl sulfide, 75-18-3; ethylbenzene, 100-41-4; meta xylene, 108-38-3; ortho xylene, 95-47-6; para xylene, 106-42-3; toluene, 108-88-3","","Abe, Akihisa, Degradation of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons by Organic Solvent-Tolerant Bacteria from Deep Sea, Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry, 59, 6, pp. 1154-1156, (1995); Abed, Raeid M.M., The direct role of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria associated with cyanobacteria in the degradation of oil compounds, International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation, 55, 1, pp. 29-37, (2005); Aldric, Jean Marc, Performance evaluation of a water/silicone oil two-phase partitioning bioreactor using Rhodococcus erythropolis T902.1 to remove volatile organic compounds from gaseous effluents, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 83, 10, pp. 1401-1408, (2008); Aldric, Jean Marc, Effect of surfactants and biomass on the gas/liquid mass transfer in an aqueous-silicone oil two-phase partitioning bioreactor using Rhodococcus erythropolis T902.1 to remove VOCs from gaseous effluents, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 84, 9, pp. 1274-1283, (2009); Aldric, Jean Marc, Study on mass transfer of isopropylbenzene and oxygen in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor in the presence of silicone oil, Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 153, 1-3, pp. 67-79, (2009); Alexander, Martin, Nonbiodegradable and other racalcitrant molecules, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 15, 4, pp. 611-647, (1973); Alvarez, Pedro J.J., Substrate interactions of benzene, toluene, and para-xylene during microbial degradation by pure cultures and mixed culture aquifer slurries, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 57, 10, pp. 2981-2985, (1991); Arriaga, Sonia Lorena, Gaseous hexane biodegradation by Fusarium solani in two liquid phase packed-bed and stirred-tank bioreactors, Environmental Science and Technology, 40, 7, pp. 2390-2395, (2006); Ascón-Cabrera, Miguel A., Selection of xenobiotic-degrading microorganisms in a biphasic aqueous- organic system, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 59, 6, pp. 1717-1724, (1993); Ascón-Cabrera, Miguel A., Cell hydrophobicity influencing the activity/stability of xenobiotic-degrading microorganisms in a continuous biphasic aqueous-organic system, Journal of Fermentation and Bioengineering, 80, 3, pp. 270-275, (1995)","","","","","","","","00496979; 15732932","","WAPLA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867330409"

In parallel, for many countries, emission control legislation becomes increasingly stringent to accommodate both public health and climate change imperatives. Effective gas biofiltration in biofilters and biotrickling filters depends on three key bioreactor variables: the support medium; gas molecule solubilization; and the catabolic population. Organic and inorganic support media, singly or in combination, have been employed and their key criteria are considered by critical appraisal of one, char. Catabolic species have included fungal and bacterial monocultures and, to a lesser extent, microbial communities. In the absence of organic support medium (soil, compost, sewage sludge, etc.) inoculum provision, a targeted enrichment and isolation program must be undertaken followed, possibly, by culture efficacy improvement. Microbial community process enhancement can then be gained by comprehensive characterization of the culturable and total populations. For all species, support medium attachment is critical and this is considered prior to filtration optimization by water content, pH, temperature, loadings, and nutrients manipulation.

The process combines toluene removal by three phase mass transfer in an aqueous adsorbent slurry with the electrochemical oxidation of the removed toluene and the regeneration of the adsorptive capacity of the adsorbent by this electrochemical process. The novel adsorbent, Nyex™, is a graphitic carbon with low surface area but is able to conduct electricity making it suitable for a system requiring rapid adsorption and adsorbent regeneration and re-use. It was demonstrated that the system could be described by a model based on physical mass transfer coupled with adsorption and the restoration of the adsorbent's adsorptive capacity. The model predicted an approximately 14% removal of inlet toluene and 12% removal during operation was observed.

The cumulative mass of the NMOCs of APD-20, APD-39, APD-49, and APD-63 accounted for 15%, 9%, 16%, and 15% of that of APD-0, respectively.

The lipid and starch contents might have significant impact on the intensity of the NMOC emissions. Alkanes dominated the NMOCs released from the aerobically pretreated MSW, while oxygenated compounds were the chief component of the NMOCs generated from untreated MSW. Aerobic pretreatment of MSW prior to landfilling reduces the organic content of the waste and the intensity of the NMOC emissions, and increases the odor threshold, thereby reducing the environmental impact of landfills. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerobic Pretreatment; Anaerobic Landfilling; Municipal Solid Waste; Non-methane Organic Compounds; Lipid; Starch; Municipal Solid Waste; Aerobic Pre-treatment; Anaerobic Decomposition; Anaerobics; Anerobic Landfilling; Landfilling; Lipid Content; Non-methane Organic Compound; Organic Content; Oxygenated Compounds; Starch Contents; Methane; Alkane; Lipid; Non Methane Organic Compound; Organic Compound; Organic Matter; Starch; Unclassified Drug; Anoxic Conditions; Decomposition; Environmental Impact; Laboratory Method; Landfill; Municipal Solid Waste; Nonmethane Hydrocarbon; Oxic Conditions; Quantitative Analysis; Aerobe; Article; Oxygenation; Solid Waste Management; Waste Component Removal","Municipal solid waste; Aerobic pre-treatment; Anaerobic decomposition; Anaerobics; Anerobic landfilling; Landfilling; Lipid content; Non-methane organic compound; Organic content; Oxygenated compounds; Starch contents; Methane; alkane; lipid; non methane organic compound; organic compound; organic matter; starch; unclassified drug; anoxic conditions; decomposition; environmental impact; laboratory method; landfill; municipal solid waste; nonmethane hydrocarbon; oxic conditions; quantitative analysis; aerobe; article; oxygenation; solid waste management; waste component removal","","lipid, 66455-18-3; starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9","The authors acknowledge the financial supports provided by National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China (NOs. 2006BAC06B01 & 2006BAC06B05 ), Beijing Science and Technology Project (NO.

It is widely recognized that biological waste-gas treatment devices such as biofilters and biotrickling filters can show high performance, often reaching removal efficiencies above 90 % for pollutant concentrations below 5 g/m 3. However, for concentrations exceeding this limit and under transient shock-load conditions that are frequently encountered in industrial situations, a physicochemical gas cleaning process can sometimes be advantageously combined with a biological one. Besides improving the overall treatment efficiency, the non-biological, first-stage process could also serve as a load equalization system by reducing the pollutant load during periodic shock-loads, to levels that can easily be handled in the second-stage bioreactor. This article reviews the operational advantages of integrating different non-biological and biological processes, i.e., adsorption pre-treatment+bioreactor, bioreactor+adsorption post-treatment, absorption pre-treatment+bioreactor, UV pre-treatment+bioreactor, and bioreactor/bioreactor combinations, for waste-gas treatment, where different gas-phase pollutants have been tested. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Bioreactor Performance; Load Equalization; Transient-state Operations; Two-stage Reactors; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste-gas Treatment; 2 Propanol; Benzene; Chloroform; Formaldehyde; Hydrogen Sulfide; Macrogol; Methanol; Phosgene; Pinene; Tetrachloroethylene; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Air Pollutants; Gases; Industrial Waste; Biological Process; Biotrickling Filters; Gas Cleaning Process; Gas-phase Pollutants; Load Equalization; Pollutant Concentration; Pollutant Loads; Post Treatment; Pre-treatment; Removal Efficiencies; Transient-state Operations; Treatment Efficiency; Treatment Techniques; Waste-gas Treatment; Adsorption; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Bioreactors; Gas Absorption; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Treatment; 2 Propanol; Absorbent; Benzene; Chloroform; Formaldehyde; Hydrogen Sulfide; Macrogol; Methanol; Mineral Oil; Phosgene; Pinene; Tetrachloroethylene; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Vegetable Oil; Volatile Organic Compound; Water Oil Cream; Absorption; Adsorption; Air Pollution Control; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Biodegradation; Biofilter; Bioreactor; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Concentration Process; Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor; Incineration; Microbial Degradation; Oxidation; Photocatalysis; Photooxidation; Physical Chemistry; Pollutant; Review; Ultraviolet Radiation; Waste Gas Management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Filtration; Fungi; Gases; Industrial Waste","Biological process; Biotrickling filters; Gas cleaning process; Gas-phase pollutants; Load equalization; Pollutant concentration; Pollutant loads; Post treatment; Pre-Treatment; Removal efficiencies; transient-state operations; Treatment efficiency; Treatment techniques; Waste-gas treatment; Adsorption; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Bioreactors; Gas absorption; Volatile organic compounds; Waste treatment; 2 propanol; absorbent; benzene; chloroform; formaldehyde; hydrogen sulfide; macrogol; methanol; mineral oil; phosgene; pinene; tetrachloroethylene; titanium dioxide; toluene; vegetable oil; volatile organic compound; water oil cream; absorption; adsorption; air pollution control; biochemical oxygen demand; biodegradation; biofilter; bioreactor; chemical oxygen demand; concentration process; continuous stirred tank reactor; incineration; microbial degradation; oxidation; photocatalysis; photooxidation; physical chemistry; pollutant; review; ultraviolet radiation; waste gas management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Filtration; Fungi; Gases; Industrial Waste","","2 propanol, 67-63-0; benzene, 71-43-2; chloroform, 67-66-3; formaldehyde, 50-00-0; hydrogen sulfide, 15035-72-0, 7783-06-4; macrogol, 25322-68-3; methanol, 67-56-1; phosgene, 75-44-5; pinene, 80-56-8; tetrachloroethylene, 127-18-4; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; toluene, 108-88-3; Air Pollutants, 0; Gases, 0; Industrial Waste, 0","","Khan, Faisal I., Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds from polluted air, Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 13, 6, pp. 527-545, (2000); Biotechnology, (1986); Bioreactors for Waste Gas Treatment, (2001); Heymes, Frédéric, A new efficient absorption liquid to treat exhaust air loaded with toluene, Chemical Engineering Journal, 115, 3, pp. 225-231, (2006); Kennes, Christian, Waste gas treatment in bioreactors: Environmental engineering aspects, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 36, 12, pp. 1887-1894, (2009); Concise Encyclopedia of Bioresource Technology, (2004); Kennes, Christian, Bioprocesses for air pollution control, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 84, 10, pp. 1419-1436, (2009); Trans Aiche, (1935); Air Pollution Control Technology Handbook, (2002); Comparing Different Biogas Upgrading Techniques, (2008)","","","","","","","","15324117; 10934529","","JATEF","22486662","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859753206"

The emissions of gaseous, liquid and particulate materials from industries have major impact on environment which leads to air and water pollution. The polluted streams comprise of criteria pollutants and hazardous pollutants (as characterized by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA. VOCs are the major pollutants released by the industries which contaminate the atmospheric air and the fresh water resources. VOCs are found to have adverse effects on human health even at very low concentrations. This chapter deals with the biofiltration studies for the removal of VOCs from and air and metal ions from water. The potential of microorganisms in consuming the VOCs as carbon source makes biodégradation and biofiltration an attractive option for the removal of pollutants from the waste air and waste water streams. The chapter discusses the various essential factors for the development of the biofiltration. It discusses in detail the importance of packing material in the biofiltration. A table is given for the operating conditions of laboratory scale biofilter and the different microbial species used for the biofiltration of VOCs and metal ions. The chapter also deals with the effect of various parameters such as time, flow rate, shock loads and bed height to check the performance of biofiltration. A very detailed study on research status of biofiltrationfor removal of VOCs, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide is given. Another research status on the upcoming field for the removal of toxic metal ions using biofiltration is given. The mechanism for the removal of organic & inorganic pollutants and metal ions is discussed in the chapter. This chapter also incorporates the applications of biofilters in various industries. © 2012 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

The text also includes the more traditional methods such as t-tests, chi-square tests, etc., but only after students have developed a strong intuitive understanding of inference through randomization methods. The text is designed for use in a one-semester introductory statistics course. The focus throughout is on data analysis and the primary goal is to enable students to effectively collect data, analyze data, and interpret conclusions drawn from data. The text is driven by real data and real applications.

The proposed system takes the advantages of low energy requirement and non-thermal process with a constant flow rate at ambient condition. In the experiments, the compositions of DMS/argon plasma, the residual gaseous phases, and solid precipitates were respectively characterized using an optical emission spectrometer, various gas-phase analyzers, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. For 400ppm DMS introduced into argon plasma with two pairs of electrodes (90W), a complete decomposition of DMS was achieved; the DMS became converted into excited species such as C*, C <inf>2</inf>*, H*, and CH*. When gaseous products were taken away from the treatment area, the excited species tended to recombine and form stable compounds or species, which formed as solid particles and gaseous phases. The solid deposition was likely formed by the agglomeration of C-, H-, and S-containing species that became deposited on the quartz inner tube. For the residual gaseous phases, low-molecular-weight segments mostly recombined into relatively thermodynamic stable species, such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon disulfide. The dissociation mechanism and treatment efficiency are discussed, and a treatment of converting DMS into H <inf>2</inf>-, CS <inf>2</inf>-, and H <inf>2</inf>S-dominant by-products is proposed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.;

The nanopowder has an average particle size of 13nm, anatase content 97wt.% and the specific surface area of 102m 2g -1. The performance was compared to the benchmark photocatalyst, the commercial pyrogenic titania P25, Evonik, with the average particle size of 21nm. The full-factorial experiments were carried out varying contact times, concentrations of pollutants and temperatures in continuous gas-flow mode degrading aliphatic acrylonitrile (AN) and aromatic toluene. Higher conversions at more stable performance were observed for the flame aerosol synthesized photocatalyst in degradation of both pollutants. While the primary particle size and specific surface area present the apparent reasons for improved PCO performance in adsorbable AN, these parameters cannot do the same in oxidation of poorly adsorbable toluene: the superior generation of hydroxyl radicals and, therefore, advanced oxidative activity are proposed as explanation. The intense dehydration of reduced size anatase crystallites at elevated temperature (130°C) presumably resulted in decreased OH-radicals production along with the improved desorption of HCN, the PCO by-product of AN. The safe performance is thus requiring lower operational temperatures. Slower deactivation and faster restoration of catalytic activity of flame aerosol synthesized catalyst under UV-A-radiation are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Flame Aerosol Synthesis; Photocatalytic Activity; Titanium Dioxide; Volatile Organic Compounds; Aerosol Synthesis; Anatase Crystallites; Average Particle Size; Contact Time; Elevated Temperature; Experimental Evaluation; Flame Aerosol Reactor; Flame Aerosol Synthesis; Gas Flows; Gasphase; Hydroxyl Radicals; Nano Powders; Nanostructured Titanium; Operational Temperature; Oxidative Activity; Photocatalytic Activities; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Primary Particle Size; Reduced Size; Tio; Titania; Uv-a-radiation; Atmospheric Aerosols; Benchmarking; Catalyst Activity; Catalyst Deactivation; Complexation; Desorption; Flame Synthesis; Nanostructured Materials; Organic Pollutants; Oxides; Particle Size; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Specific Surface Area; Titanium; Titanium Dioxide; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Pollution","Aerosol synthesis; Anatase crystallites; Average particle size; Contact time; Elevated temperature; Experimental evaluation; Flame aerosol reactor; Flame aerosol synthesis; Gas flows; Gasphase; Hydroxyl radicals; Nano powders; Nanostructured titanium; Operational temperature; Oxidative activity; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic oxidations; Primary particle size; Reduced size; TiO; Titania; UV-A-radiation; Atmospheric aerosols; Benchmarking; Catalyst activity; Catalyst deactivation; Complexation; Desorption; Flame synthesis; Nanostructured materials; Organic pollutants; Oxides; Particle size; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Specific surface area; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollution","","","","Rene, Eldon Raj, Performance evaluation of a compost biofilter treating toluene vapours, Process Biochemistry, 40, 8, pp. 2771-2779, (2005); Revah, Sergio M., Methods of odor and VOC control, pp. 29-63, (2005); Vaart, D.

Although photocatalytic systems have been demonstrated at the laboratory scale for the removal of a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), commercial systems have various limitations including poor mass transfer, fragile components, and incomplete oxidation. A novel, robust, and highly effective Silica-Titania Composite (STC) technology has been developed that is capable of adsorbing and oxidizing VOCs through photocatalytic processes. The STC technology overcomes many of the deficiencies found in other photocatalytic technologies, offering a robust, high surface area material that can oxidize VOCs without the emission of hazardous byproducts. Sol Gel Solutions has fabricated a prototype to house the STC pellets, and has evaluated the unit for the removal of ethanol from an air stream. Optimization of the technology has been conducted, including a comparison between the use of UV lamps (365nm and 254nm) and UV LEDs (365 nm) in various arrangements. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

VOCs are easily absorbed and broadly metabolized in the human body (Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry [ATSDR], 2004). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has specified a number of VOCs as air toxics. In many urban areas of Asia, several anthropogenic sources, such as traffic, residential, and industry, release large amounts of VOCs into the atmosphere, which subsequently build up to high ambient levels. In the atmosphere with the presence of sunlight, VOCs participate in photochemical reactions with NO<inf>x</inf> (nitrogen oxides) to form photochemical smog. High levels of fine particles and surface ozone present in the smog are health hazards.

There is cost to heat, cool, humidify or dehumidify the outdoor air depending on the location and season. This leads to a balancing act between indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy cost. Ultraviolet photocatalytic oxidation (UV-PCO) has been acclaimed as one of these innovative technologies for purifying indoor air by decomposition of pollutants, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Although numerous studies have been carried out in this field, UVPCO performance under real life applications is still questionable. Experimental conditions of most previous works focused on ppm level of VOCs in ideal bench-top-scale reactor with low flow-rate and high residence time conditions. On the other hand, limited research has been devoted to investigate generation of the UV-PCO toxic by-products and this issue is one of the main drawbacks and obstacles in its wide applications and design of immune buildings. This paper represents the outcomes of an experimental study which was performed to investigate the generation of the by-products under single pass through duct system. By-products in photodegradation of n-hexane as a result of ozone producing VUV lamps with 254nm+185nm wavelength radiations have been compared with UVC lamps with 254nm wavelength radiation. Two types of catalyst media were used to investigate the feasibility of UV-PCO technology. Removal efficiency and by-products identification results are presented and discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Quality; Costs; Hexane; Humidity Control; Lighting; Product Design; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wavemeters; By-products Identifications; Experimental Conditions; Indoor Air Quality; Innovative Technology; Photocatalytic Oxidations; Real-life Applications; Removal Efficiencies; Wavelength Radiation; Indoor Air Pollution","Air quality; Costs; Hexane; Humidity control; Lighting; Product design; Volatile organic compounds; Wavemeters; By-products identifications; Experimental conditions; Indoor air quality; Innovative technology; Photocatalytic oxidations; Real-life applications; Removal efficiencies; Wavelength radiation; Indoor air pollution","","","","Laboratory Test Method for Assessing the Performance of Gas Phase Air Cleaning Systems Loose Granular Media, (2008); Augugliaro, Vincenzo, Photocatalytic oxidation of gaseous toluene on anatase TiO2 catalyst: Mechanistic aspects and FT-IR investigation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 20, 1, pp. 15-27, (1999); Benoît-Marquié, Florence, VOC photodegradation at the gas-solid interface of a TiO2 photocatalyst: Part I: 1-butanol and 1-butylamine, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, 132, 3, pp. 225-232, (2000); Bickley, Roger I., Photo-adsorption and photo-catalysis on titanium dioxide surfaces: Photo-adsorption of oxygen and the photocatalyzed oxidation of isopropanol, Faraday Discussions, 58, pp. 194-204, (1974); Boulamanti, Aikaterini K., Photocatalytic degradation of C5-C7 alkanes in the gas-phase, Atmospheric Environment, 43, 20, pp. 3168-3174, (2009); Cao, Lixin, Photocatalytic oxidation of toluene on nanoscale TiO2 catalysts: Studies of deactivation and regeneration, Journal of Catalysis, 196, 2, pp. 253-261, (2000); Chin, Paul, Formaldehyde removal from air via a rotating adsorbent combined with a photocatalyst reactor: Kinetic modeling, Journal of Catalysis, 237, 1, pp. 29-37, (2006); Cunningham, Joseph F., Kinetic studies of secondary alcohol photo-oxidation on ZnO and TiO2 at 348 K studied by gas-chromatographic analysis, Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions I, 77, 11, pp. 2777-2801, (1981); D'Hennezel, Olga B., Benzene and toluene gas-phase photocatalytic degradation over H2O and HCL pretreated TiO2: By-products and mechanisms, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, 118, 3, pp. 197-204, (1998); Djeghri, N., Photointeraction on the surface of titanium dioxide between oxygen and alkanes, Faraday Discussions, 58, pp. 185-193, (1974)","","American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)","","7th International Cold Climate HVAC Conference","","Calgary; AB","113013","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938888439"

Air pollution is an issue of sensible concern due to the serious implications on health and environment. The contaminants present in industrial waste-gases should either be destroyed or removed from an exhaust vent before it is emitted into the atmosphere by a particular process industry. Traditional waste-gas treatment systems, based on physico-chemical processes for pollutant removal, exhibits high energy costs, expend more chemicals, and produces more wastes. These systems have proved to be economical only when the waste-stream contains high concentrations of pollutants, which can either be recovered or destroyed completely. The use of well-adapted microorganisms to decontaminante the pollutants present in waste-gases, by maintaining them in suitable bioreactor configurations, can eliminate the drawbacks of classical physico-chemical techniques. In recent years, biological waste-gas treatment systems have been successfully used in a wide variety of process industries, particularly when the exhaust gas-stream contains low concentrations of pollutant at high gas-flow rates. Biological waste-gas treatment systems are versatile in handling a wide variety of air-emissions, comprising both individual and mixture of pollutants, from petrochemical, semi-conductor, paint and varnish production facilities, pharmaceutical and paper and pulp industry, among others. The different bioprocesses that are commonly used for air pollution control are the biofilters, biotrickling filters and bioscrubbers. However, recent scientific advances and technical discoveries have led to the development of novel bioreactor configurations that have shown to be successful and promising for treating air toxics with high removal efficiencies. We reviewed the operational details and performance of novel bioreactor configurations such as continuous suspended-growth bioreactors, monolith bioreactors, two-liquid-phase biotrickling filters, air-lift bioreactors, fluidized-bed bioreactors, and foam-emulsion bioreactors. Though all these bioreactors have not been examined at the industrial level for operational/practical constraints, they have shown to effectively handle a wide range of hydrophilic and hydrophobic air pollutants, when investigated at the lab-scale level for steady and transient-state performance. Closely looking at their advantages, we observed that all these novel bioreactors were designed to overcome some operational limitations, viz., flow resistance/pressure drop, oxygen depletion and mass transfer problems for sparingly soluble pollutants, frequently encountered in conventional biological treatment systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Air Quality; Bioconversion; Biodegradation; Bioenergy; Biofilters; Biofuel; Biogas; Biomass; Bioprocesses; Bioreactor Modelling; Btex; Carbon Dioxide; Co; Cs2; Elimination Capacity; Gas Treatment; Greenhouse Gas; H2s; Hap; Hydrogen Sulphide; Methane; Microbial Kinetics; Mtbe; Natural Gas; Nh3; Novel Bioreactors; Ozonation; Photooxidation; Removal Efficiency; Siloxanes; So2; Trichloroethylene; Voc; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Gas; Air Pollution; Air Pollution Control; Air Quality; Bioconversion; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofuels; Biogas; Biological Water Treatment; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cobalt; Emulsification; Exhaust Gases; Fluidization; Fluidized Beds; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Hydrogen Sulfide; Indicators (chemical); Methane; Natural Gas; Ozone Water Treatment; Ozonization; Paper And Pulp Industry; Paper And Pulp Mills; Photooxidation; Pollution; Pollution Control; Removal; River Pollution; Silicon Compounds; Sulfur Dioxide; Trichloroethylene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Treatment; Water Pollution; Bio-energy; Bioprocesses; Btex; Elimination Capacity; Gas Treatment; Hs; Microbial Kinetics; Mtbe; Nh; Removal Efficiencies; Siloxanes; So; Waste Gas; Gases","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Bioconversion; Biodegradation; Biofilters; Biofuels; Biogas; Biological water treatment; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cobalt; Emulsification; Exhaust gases; Fluidization; Fluidized beds; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen sulfide; Indicators (chemical); Methane; Natural gas; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Paper and pulp industry; Paper and pulp mills; Photooxidation; Pollution; Pollution control; Removal; River pollution; Silicon compounds; Sulfur dioxide; Trichloroethylene; Volatile organic compounds; Waste treatment; Water pollution; Bio-energy; Bioprocesses; BTEX; Elimination capacity; Gas treatment; HS; Microbial kinetics; MTBE; NH; Removal efficiencies; Siloxanes; SO; Waste gas; Gases","","","","Arriaga, Sonia Lorena, Gaseous hexane biodegradation by Fusarium solani in two liquid phase packed-bed and stirred-tank bioreactors, Environmental Science and Technology, 40, 7, pp. 2390-2395, (2006); Arulneyam, Durai, Biodegradation of ethanol vapour in a biofilter, Bioprocess Engineering, 22, 1, pp. 63-67, (2000); Arulneyam, Durai, Biodegradation of methanol vapor in a biofilter, Journal of Environmental Sciences (China), 15, 5, pp. 691-696, (2003); Bagreev, Andrey A., Oxidative adsorption of methyl mercaptan on nitrorgen-enriched bituminous coal-based activated carbon, Carbon, 43, 1, pp. 208-210, (2005); Bailón, Laura, Removal of dichloromethane from waste gases in one- and two-liquid-phase stirred tank bioreactors and biotrickling filters, Water Research, 43, 1, pp. 11-20, (2009); Wasser Luft Boden, (1989); Ray, Madhumita Bhowmick, Batch studies on a closed loop air stripping process, Water Research, 28, 9, pp. 2011-2019, (1994); Bioreactors for Waste Gas Treatment, (2001); Blocki, Stephen W., Hydrophobic zeolite adsorbent: A proven advancement in solvent separation technology, Environmental Progress, 12, 3, pp. 226-230, (1993); Emerging Technologies in Hazardous Waste Management III, (1993)","","Springer Netherlands","","","","","","","9400724411; 9789400724389; 9400791968; 9789400724396","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931475734"

The Lagrangian framework provides an intuitive means for addressing this question as it allows establishing a direct link between emission sources and receiving monitoring sites (receptors) in the form of air parcel trajectories. For chemically reactive air pollutants, it further offers the possibility to separate effects due to chemical processing from physical processing by atmospheric mixing and transport. In this section, two examples of chemical Lagrangian modeling are presented, both employing sophisticated transport models combined with comparatively simple chemistry modules. However, these examples only represent a small proportion of the wide spectrum of Lagrangian modeling of atmospheric chemistry. A broader overview of the topic is presented here reviewing a range of existing modeling approaches. Gaps in our understanding or lack of appropriate modeling tools are briefly discussed at the end, and potential areas of future research are outlined. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

In this study, UV photodegradation was developed as a strategy of controlling biomass accumulation to recover BF and BTF for the treatment of gaseous alpha-pinene (α-pinene) over long-term period. With the addition of UV, an overall efficiency of more than 85% was re-achieved in BTF since excessive biomass was removed. Due to continuous positive effects by UV photodegradation, biomass concentration in the BTF was kept at a normal level (9.25-9.58kgm-3dry carrier), and the maximum elimination capacity and CO<inf>2</inf> production increased by 4.2 and 6.2 times that achieved by the deteriorated BTF. Microbial analysis revealed that microbial community structure in BTF became more complicated with the addition of UV photodegradation. Kinetic analysis indicated that photodegradation could improve the removal process of α-pinene in BTF. Contrarily, UV photodegradation could not recover BF based on similar experiments. These findings provided a potential use of UV photodegradation for maintenance of biotrickling filtration efficient for gaseous pollutants removal over long-term operation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofilters; Microbial Analysis; Recover; Removal Performance; Uv Photodegradation; Alpha-pinenes; Biological Removal; Biomass Accumulation; Biomass Concentrations; Biotrickling; Biotrickling Filters; Elimination Capacity; Gaseous Pollutants; Kinetic Analysis; Long-term Operation; Long-term Period; Microbial Analysis; Microbial Community Structures; Overall Efficiency; Positive Effects; Recover; Removal Process; Uv Photodegradation; Vapor Phase; Atmospheric Composition; Biofilters; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Carrier Concentration; Fog; Recovery; Biofiltration","Alpha-pinenes; Biological removal; Biomass accumulation; Biomass concentrations; Biotrickling; Biotrickling filters; Elimination capacity; Gaseous pollutants; Kinetic analysis; Long-term operation; Long-term period; Microbial analysis; Microbial community structures; Overall efficiency; Positive effects; Recover; Removal process; UV photodegradation; Vapor Phase; Atmospheric composition; Biofilters; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carrier concentration; Fog; Recovery; Biofiltration","","","This study was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 20976165 and 21177116 ), the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (20093317110003) and Zhejiang Provincial Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists (R5090230) .

Many reactor configurations have been developed to generate a NTP at atmospheric pressure. Therefore in this review article, the principles of generating NTPs are outlined. Further on, this paper is divided in two equally important parts: plasma-alone and plasma-catalytic systems. Combination of NTP with heterogeneous catalysis has attracted increased attention in order to overcome the weaknesses of plasma-alone systems. An overview is given of the present understanding of the mechanisms involved in plasma-catalytic processes. In both parts (plasma-alone systems and plasma-catalysis), literature on the abatement of VOCs is reviewed in close detail.

Adsorption capacity of the catalyst to toluene and the temperature-rising curve in the field of microwave were also examined in this study. CuO/zeolite catalyst was mixed with silicon carbide (SiC), one of the excellent microwave-absorbing materials, to treat synergistically toluene waste gas by microwave through a fixed bed reactor. The results showed that copper oxide was dispersed uniformly onto the surface of zeolite, and the adsorption of the catalyst to toluene was monolayer with the amount of 11 mg·g-1. The temperature rise quickly and reaches 460°C in one minute for CuO/zeolite catalyst and SiC mixture under microwave irradiation. Toluene was degraded effectively by CuO/zeolite catalyst and SiC, and the removal efficiency reached 94% under given parameters. The activity of the catalyst was stable after 10 hours run.

The results show that, under a fixed energy input density, introducing active carbon into plasma reactor can promote the decomposition of DMS obviously; the decomposition of DMS increases with increasing energy density input, and when the energy input density is more than 288 J·L-1, the decomposition of DMS exceeds 98%. While the decomposition of DMS decreases with increasing initial DMS concentration and gas flow rate. It was found that, under the experiment conditions, the humidity has an obvious effect on the decomposition of DMS, and the relative humidity of 25% (20°C) is most beneficial for the decomposition of DMS. The by-products of the decomposition can be effectively controlled by introducing active carbon into the dielectric barrier plasma discharge. After introducing AC, the concentrations of O<inf>3</inf> and SO<inf>2</inf> in outlet gas reduce from 242 mg·cm-3 and 140 mg·cm-3 to 20 mg·cm-3 and 50 mg·cm-3, respectively. The added active carbon can keep high adsorption activity for 80 h under an energy input density of 450 J·L-1. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Carbon; By-products; Dielectric Barrier Plasma Discharge; Dimethyl Sulfide; Active Carbon; Adsorption Activity; Dielectric Barrier; Dimethyl Sulfide; Energy Density; Energy Inputs; Experiment Condition; Fixed Energy; Outlet Gas; Plasma Discharge; Plasma Reactors; Adsorption; Diamonds; Plasma Applications; Plasmas; Sulfur Dioxide; Electric Discharges","Active carbon; Adsorption activity; Dielectric barrier; Dimethyl sulfide; Energy density; Energy inputs; Experiment condition; Fixed energy; Outlet gas; Plasma discharge; Plasma reactors; Adsorption; Diamonds; Plasma applications; Plasmas; Sulfur dioxide; Electric discharges","","","","Helfritch, Dennis J., Pulsed corona discharge for hydrogen sulfide decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 29, 5, pp. 882-886, (1993); Shi, Yao, Decomposition of mixed malodorants in a wire-plate pulse corona reactor, Environmental Science and Technology, 39, 17, pp. 6786-6791, (2005); Cao, Jing, Decomposition of dimethyl sulfide with non-thermal plasma induced by dielectric barrier discharge, Gao Xiao Hua Xue Gong Cheng Xue Bao/Journal of Chemical Engineering of Chinese Universities, 21, 6, pp. 1060-1064, (2007); Chen, Jie, Influence of balance gas mixture on decomposition of dimethyl sulfide in a wire-cylinder pulse corona reactor, Chemosphere, 75, 2, pp. 261-265, (2009); van Durme, Jim, Combining non-thermal plasma with heterogeneous catalysis in waste gas treatment: A review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 78, 3-4, pp. 324-333, (2008); Guo, Yufang, Toluene decomposition using a wire-plate dielectric barrier discharge reactor with manganese oxide catalyst in situ, Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 245, 1-2, pp. 93-100, (2006); Lu, Bin, Decomposition of benzene by dielectric barrier plasma discharge and catalysis, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science, 26, 6, pp. 703-707, (2006); Zhu, Tao, Degradation of toluene in exhaust gas with plasma and nano-materials, Zhongguo Huanjing Kexue/China Environmental Science, 28, 8, pp. 699-703, (2008); Urashima, Kuniko, Destruction of volatile organic compounds in air by a superimposed barrier discharge plasma reactor and activated carbon filter hybrid system, Conference Record - IAS Annual Meeting (IEEE Industry Applications Society), 3, pp. 1969-1974, (1997); Faria, Patrícia C.C., Catalytic ozonation of sulfonated aromatic compounds in the presence of activated carbon, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 83, 1-2, pp. 150-159, (2008)","","","","","","","","10039015","","GHGXE","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960040734"

This defines about 200 chemical compounds such alcohols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, esters, etc. excluding CH<inf>4</inf>. The European Union defines VOCs as any organic compounds that have a starting boiling point lower or equal to 250°C measured in standard atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa). VOCs are harmful due to different factors; on the one hand, they form part of the photochemical smog and some of them participate in the greenhouse effect and on the other hand, some of them are cancerous or teratogenics. VOCs sources are classified in biogenic, created by nature, and anthropogenic mainly linked to transport and use of solvents. The control of VOCs can be divided in two groups: primary, which is related to technological substitution and secondary, which are related to the elimination at the end of pipe. The last technologies are also classified in recovery methods (adsorption, condensation, membranes) and destruction methods (biofiltration, thermal and catalytic oxidation). © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This class includes pure hydrocarbons, partially oxidized hydrocarbons (organic acids, aldehydes, ketone), as well as organics containing chlorine, sulfur, nitrogen, or other elements. These compounds are usually found in most manufacturing processes, either for the raw materials, intermediates, or the finished products. Organic materials are present as chemicals, solvents, release agents, coatings, decomposition products, pigments, and so on that eventually must be disposed. Catalytic incineration is a well known process to destruct VOC emissions in air at low energy cost; it is useful when these contaminants are toxic and malodorous. The advantages of catalytic oxidation can be important mainly because of potential savings following the lower temperatures required. The environmental impact can be improved because both higher efficiency of abatement and lower levels of NO<inf>x</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions can be reached. Furthermore the small pressure drops make the process very attractive. This article aims to show and discuss the results from continuous tests conducted in the laboratory scale reactors. Measurements of the abatement in the simulated industrial conditions, the assessment of the catalyst aging, and the identification of the possible poisoning will be shown. The catalyst powders were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method with aqueous solutions of metal nitrate and calcined at proper temperatures. The finished catalysts were characterized first by DTA-TGA. The effects of operating parameters, such as inlet temperature, space velocity, VOCs inlet concentration, and oxygen concentration on the catalytic incineration of VOCs over the catalysts were then performed. The activity of the catalyst decreased significantly with time while VOCs incineration was operated under a low temperature. However, the activity of the catalyst did not change much while the operating temperature was high. The catalysts were characterized by the surface and pore size analysis, XRD, XPS, EDS and SEM before and after the tests. Three kinetic models (i.e., the power-rate law, the Mars and Van Krevelen model, and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model) were used to analyze the results. A differential reactor design was used for best fit of kinetic models in this study. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The improved behaviour for CO oxidation has been linked to the simultaneous presence of Auδ+ and Au°. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Co; Co3o4; Gold; Nanocasting Route; Propane; Toluene; Total Oxidation; Carbon Monoxide; Gold; Propane; Silicon Dioxide; Toluene; Cobalt; Environmental Pollutants; Gold; Oxides; Cobalt Oxide; Ambient Temperatures; Co; Co Oxidation; Coo; Cobalt Oxides; Deep Oxidation; Enhanced Catalytic Activity; Hard Templates; High Activity; High Surface Area; Intrinsic Activities; Metallic Gold; Nanocasting; Total Oxidation; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cobalt; Gold; Mesoporous Materials; Metallic Compounds; Propane; Toluene; Gold Coatings; Carbon Monoxide; Cobalt Oxide; Gold; Metal Oxide; Propane; Silicon Dioxide; Toluene; Unclassified Drug; Catalyst; Cobalt; Experimental Study; Oxidation; Surface Area; Temperature Effect; Article; Catalysis; Environmental Temperature; Pollutant; Room Temperature; X Ray Powder Diffraction; Catalysis; Environmental Pollutants; Nanotechnology; Oxidation-reduction; Oxides; Surface Properties","Ambient temperatures; CO; CO oxidation; CoO; Cobalt oxides; Deep oxidation; Enhanced catalytic activity; Hard templates; High activity; High surface area; Intrinsic activities; Metallic gold; Nanocasting; Total oxidation; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cobalt; Gold; Mesoporous materials; Metallic compounds; Propane; Toluene; Gold coatings; carbon monoxide; cobalt oxide; gold; metal oxide; propane; silicon dioxide; toluene; unclassified drug; catalyst; cobalt; experimental study; oxidation; surface area; temperature effect; article; catalysis; environmental temperature; pollutant; room temperature; X ray powder diffraction; Catalysis; Environmental Pollutants; Nanotechnology; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides; Surface Properties","","carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; gold, 7440-57-5; propane, 74-98-6; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; toluene, 108-88-3; Cobalt, 7440-48-4; Environmental Pollutants, 0; Gold, 7440-57-5; Oxides, 0; cobalt oxide, 11104-61-3","The authors would like to thank Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (Project CTQ2006- 02386 and Project CTQ2009-14495) for financial support.","Catalysis, (2004); Wani, Altaf H., Biofiltration: A promising and cost-effective control technology for odors, VOCs and air toxics, Journal of Environmental Science and Health - Part A Toxic/Hazardous Substances and Environmental Engineering, 32, 7, pp. 2027-2055, (1997); Everaert, Kim, Catalytic combustion of volatile organic compounds, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 109, 1-3, pp. 113-139, (2004); Everaert, Kim, Combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons in catalyst-coated sintered metal fleece reactors, Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology, 78, 2-3, pp. 167-172, (2003); Choudhary, Tushar V., Catalysts for combustion of methane and lower alkanes, Applied Catalysis A: General, 234, 1-2, pp. 1-23, (2002); Thevenin, Philippe O., Catalytic processes to convert methane: Partial or total oxidation.

It is an acknowledged fact that world's major energy needs are met from thermal power generation which depends mainly on the combustion of fossil fuels. On the other hand, these combustion systems have elevated much of the environmental problems. One of the emission gases of most serious concern is nitrogen oxide (NO<inf>x</inf>), which causes acid rain, global warming and ozone depletion. To settle the global environmental and energy issues, the combustion systems need to be much more improved for high efficiency and low pollutant emissions. Catalytic combustion has been developed as a method of promoting efficient combustion over a wide range of air-to-fuel ratios with a minimum pollutant formation at low temperatures as compared to conventional flame combustion. The application of catalysts facilitates efficient combustion of hydrocarbons at relatively lower temperatures without promoting oxidation of nitrogen and also stringent control over the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Generally, effective emission control is often achieved by the use of noble metal catalysts; they are very active at low temperatures but due to the economical reasons, as well as limited availability of noble metals, motivated the investigation into the alternative materials for catalytic combustion. Metal oxides are the promising option, because they are relatively cheap, show variable valency and exhibit greater redox characteristics. Mixed metal oxides in the form of perovskites, hexa-aluminates and doped metal oxides are promising because of their thermal stability at high temperatures, low cost, and flexible composition. Among doped metal oxides, ceria-based materials are attractive in catalytic combustion apart from three-way-catalytic applications, VOC abatement, and fuel cell technologies due to their ease of redox and high thermal stability. Metal oxide catalysts exhibit good catalytic activity in narrow temperature range. However, the catalytic combustion range is up to 1773 K for that, it is necessary to add supports to increase the thermal stability. Recently, it has been reported that ceria supported on lanthanum hexa-aluminate shows an impressive activity and stability up to 1273 K. In this chapter we have concentrated on the catalytic application of pure metal oxides, and mixed metal oxides such as perovskites, hexa-aluminates and ceria doped materials for catalytic combustion. We also discussed the significance of supports to metal oxides to improve the catalytic efficiency at high temperatures. Finally, we have provided new directions for future work on this subject. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Materials based on the polymerisation of β-cyclodextrin onto inert solids have been developed and used as biomass supports for the biofiltration of air contaminated with toluene. Several supports were prepared by the crosslinking of β-cyclodextrin with epichlorohydrin onto commercial polymers and evaluated in pilot-scale biofilters for different testing periods. Batches of high density polyethylene rings and two types of reticulated polyurethane foam cubes were used as structural frameworks of the cyclodextrin polymer. Each support material was inoculated with an acclimated microbial culture and packed separately in different modules. The influent gas stream was prepared by vaporizing liquid toluene in air. In a first phase, a module with polyurethane cubes and another one with high density polyethylene rings were studied in the same biofilter for 23 and 12 months, respectively. The second phase, which lasted 20 months, worked with new polyurethane foam cubes in twin biofilters, one with the support particles coated with the cyclodextrin polymer and the other without this coating. In the third phase, the biofilters were operated under extreme conditions of high organic loads and total nutrient limitation during 9 months. Because of an irregular nutrient watering, the biofilters were operated under non-optimal conditions during practically the whole experimentation period. Organic loading rates up to 117 g/m3h and gas residence times between 0.45 and 7.0 min were applied. In general, the efficiency of the hydrogel-coated particles was somewhat higher than the non-coated corresponding support. The performance of cyclodextrin polymer supported onto the polyurethane cubes was more satisfactory than that over the polyethylene rings, with a maximum toluene elimination capacity of 103 g/m3h. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, such patterns are common in practical applications. In order to provide long-term stable operation of a biofilter under these conditions, a cyclic adsorption/desorption beds system with flow switching was installed prior to a biofilter. Different square waves of a mixture containing n-hexane and benzene at a 2:1 ratio were applied to the cyclic adsorption/desorption beds and then fed to a biofilter. The performance of this integrated system was compared to a biofilter unit receiving the same feed of both VOCs. The cyclic adsorption/desorption beds unit successfully achieved its goal of stabilizing erratic loading even with very sharp peaks at the influent concentration equalizing influent concentrations ranging from 10-470. ppmv for n-hexane to 30-1410. ppmv for benzene. The study included different peak concentrations with durations ranging from 6 to 20. min. The cyclic beds buffered the fluctuating influent load and the followed biofilter had all the time a continuous stable flow. Another advantage achieved by the cyclic adsorption/desorption beds was the uninterrupted feed to the biofilter even during the starvation where there was no influent in the feed. The results of the integrated system with regard to removal efficiency and kinetics are comparable to published results with continuous feed studies at the same loading rates. The removal efficiency for benzene had a minimum of 85% while for n-hexane ranged from 50% to 77% according to the loading rate. The control unit showed very erratic performance highlighting the benefit of the utilization of the cyclic adsorption/desorption beds. The biofilter was more adaptable to concentration changes in benzene than n-hexane. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Cyclic Adsorption/desorption Bed; Fungi; Trickle Bed Air Biofilter (tbab); Benzene; Hexane; Adsorption; Benzene; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biological Filter Beds; Efficiency; Fungi; Hexane; Integrated Control; Mixtures; Adsorption/desorption; Concentration Change; Influent Concentrations; Integrated Systems; Loading Patterns; Peak Concentrations; Removal Efficiencies; Trickle Bed Air Biofilters; Biofilters; Benzene; Hexane; Adsorption; Alkane; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Desorption; Fungus; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Pollution; Article; Biofilter; Filter Reactor; Fungus Growth; Hydrophobicity; Kinetics; Vapor","Adsorption; Benzene; Biodegradation; Biofiltration; Biological filter beds; Efficiency; Fungi; Hexane; Integrated control; Mixtures; Adsorption/desorption; Concentration change; Influent concentrations; Integrated systems; Loading patterns; Peak concentrations; Removal efficiencies; Trickle bed air biofilters; Biofilters; benzene; hexane; adsorption; alkane; biodegradation; biofiltration; desorption; fungus; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; biofilter; filter reactor; fungus growth; hydrophobicity; kinetics; vapor","","benzene, 71-43-2; hexane, 110-54-3","The authors would like to thank the financial support from National Science Foundation under Award # CBET 0852803.

The activity towards the deep oxidation of VOC was in the order: Au/CeO<inf>2</inf>≥Ag/CeO<inf>2</inf>>Cu/CeO<inf>2</inf>»CeO<inf>2</inf>. The same trend was also found in the PROX reaction in terms of total conversion of O<inf>2</inf>, which includes O<inf>2</inf> consumed both for CO and H<inf>2</inf> oxidation. A different behaviour was observed in the CO conversion to CO<inf>2</inf>, that is the desired PROX reaction. For this reaction, in fact, Au and Cu catalysts gave high CO conversions, Au/CeO<inf>2</inf> at low temperature (maximum of 84.3% for AuDP at 70°C) and Cu/CeO<inf>2</inf> at higher temperature (maximum of 96.8% for CuCP at 150°C), whereas Ag catalysts always exhibited very low CO conversions (maximum of 16.7% for AgCP at 80°C). Both for PROX and VOC combustion the Au sample prepared by DP was more active than the CP one, whereas a reverse behaviour was found on Ag and Cu catalysts. On the basis of characterization data (XRD, H<inf>2</inf>-TPR, surface area measurements, H<inf>2</inf>-D<inf>2</inf> isotopic exchange, N<inf>2</inf>O and H<inf>2</inf>-O<inf>2</inf> chemisorption) it was proposed that a higher atomic radius of the IB metal and the presence of smaller crystallites of both IB metal and ceria result in a larger enhancement of mobility/reactivity of surface ceria oxygens, involved in both investigated reactions through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The very low PROX activity of Ag/CeO<inf>2</inf> samples was related to the low capacity of silver to activate the CO molecule. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerium Oxide; Copper; Deep Oxidation; Gold; Prox; Silver; Voc; Ag Catalysts; Atomic Radius; Catalytic Combustion; Cerium Oxides; Co Conversion; Co Molecule; Deep Oxidation; Deposition-precipitation; Higher Temperatures; Isotopic Exchange; Low Temperatures; Mars-van Krevelen; Metal Catalyst; Preferential Oxidation; Prox; Prox Reaction; Surface Area Measurement; Voc; Voc Combustion; Xrd; Catalysis; Catalyst Activity; Catalytic Oxidation; Cerium; Cerium Compounds; Chemisorption; Coprecipitation; Gold Deposits; Oxides; Oxygen; Silver; Volatile Organic Compounds; Reverse Combustion","Ag catalysts; Atomic radius; Catalytic combustion; Cerium oxides; CO conversion; CO molecule; Deep oxidation; Deposition-precipitation; Higher temperatures; Isotopic exchange; Low temperatures; Mars-van Krevelen; Metal catalyst; Preferential oxidation; PROX; PROX reaction; Surface area measurement; VOC; VOC combustion; XRD; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Cerium; Cerium compounds; Chemisorption; Coprecipitation; Gold deposits; Oxides; Oxygen; Silver; Volatile organic compounds; Reverse combustion","","","","Trovarelli, Alessandro, Catalytic properties of ceria and CeO2-Containing materials, Catalysis Reviews - Science and Engineering, 38, 4, pp. 439-520, (1996); Trovarelli, Alessandro, The utilization of ceria in industrial catalysis, Catalysis Today, 50, 2, pp. 353-367, (1999); Dai, Qiguang, Low-temperature catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene over cerium oxide and catalyst deactivation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 81, 3-4, pp. 192-202, (2008); Liu, Wei, Total oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane over transition metal fluorite oxide composite catalysts: I.

It was reviewed that only reactor material was an independent variable among the potential control factors concerned. It was also suggested that main mechanism by EB should be radical reaction for the VOC removal rather than that by primary electrons. It was discussed that the removal efficiency of benzene was lower than that of hexane due to a closed benzene ring. In the case of aromatic VOCs, it was observed that the decomposition of the VOCs with more functional groups attached on the benzene ring was much easier than those with less ones. As for aliphatic VOCs, it was also implied that the longer carbon chain was, the higher the removal efficiency became. An EB-catalyst hybrid system was discussed as an alternative way to remove VOCs more effectively than EB-only system due to much less by-products.

The catalysts were prepared by liquid phase reduction deposition (LPRD) and by incipient wetness impregnation (IMP). It was observed that the preparation method can have a significant effect on the dispersion of the metallic phase, and subsequently on the performance of the catalysts towards total oxidation of CO or VOC.For CO oxidation, Au IMP was the worst catalyst, while Au LPRD was the most active. This can be explained in terms of different Au particle sizes, well known to be related with catalytic activity. For all the other metals, LPRD also produces better results, although the differences are not so marked as with gold. Iridium seems to be the only exception since results were very similar.In VOC oxidation, the following performance trend was observed: Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf>>Pd/TiO<inf>2</inf>{right double angle bracket}Rh/TiO<inf>2</inf>≈Ir/TiO<inf>2</inf>{right double angle bracket}Au/TiO<inf>2</inf>, for both preparation methods.

It was observed that toluene inhibits the combustion of ethanol, namely by slowing down the partial oxidation of ethanol towards acetaldehyde.

The former showed higher efficiencies for toluene decomposition and suppression of NOx formation than the latter. To clarify the difference in effectiveness between SrTiO<inf>3</inf> and BaTiO<inf>3</inf>, the waveforms of applied voltage and discharge current were investigated in detail using an oscilloscope. Many discharge current pulses were observed in both reactors when plasma discharge was generated. However, plasma conditions, such as maximum value and numbers of pulsed discharge current peaks in one cycle, differed greatly between the two reactors even at the same input power. The results suggested that plasma conditions could be changed by changing the ferroelectric pellets in the packed-bed plasma reactor. We proposed different models of discharge mode in the two plasma reactors, based on the effect of the ferroelectrics on plasma reaction. © 2010 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nox; Packed-bed Plasma Reactor; Reaction Mechanism; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Applied Voltages; Discharge Current Pulse; Discharge Currents; Discharge Mode; Ferroelectric Pellets; Higher Efficiency; Input Power; Maximum Values; Nonthermal Plasma Reactors; Nox Formation; Plasma Conditions; Plasma Discharge; Plasma Methods; Plasma Reactions; Plasma Reactors; Pulsed Discharge; Reaction Mechanism; Srtio; Toluene Decomposition; Wave Forms; Ferroelectric Materials; Ferroelectricity; Pelletizing; Plasma Applications; Plasma Theory; Strontium Alloys; Toluene; Volatile Organic Compounds; Electric Discharges","Applied voltages; Discharge current pulse; Discharge currents; Discharge mode; Ferroelectric pellets; Higher efficiency; Input power; Maximum values; Nonthermal plasma reactors; NOx formation; Plasma conditions; Plasma discharge; Plasma methods; Plasma reactions; Plasma reactors; Pulsed discharge; Reaction mechanism; SrTiO; Toluene decomposition; Wave forms; Ferroelectric materials; Ferroelectricity; Pelletizing; Plasma applications; Plasma theory; Strontium alloys; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Electric discharges","","","","Chen, Hsinliang, Removal of volatile organic compounds by single-stage and two-stage plasma catalysis systems: A review of the performance enhancement mechanisms, current status, and suitable applications, Environmental Science and Technology, 43, 7, pp. 2216-2227, (2009); van Durme, Jim, Combining non-thermal plasma with heterogeneous catalysis in waste gas treatment: A review, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 78, 3-4, pp. 324-333, (2008); Kim, Hyun-Ha, Nonthermal plasma processing for air-pollution control: A historical review, current issues, and future prospects, Plasma Processes and Polymers, 1, 2, pp. 91-110, (2004); Kim, Hyun-Ha, Microscopic observation of discharge plasma on the surface of zeolites supported metal nanoparticles, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 42, 13, (2009); Kim, Hyun-Ha, Comparative assessment of different nonthermal plasma reactors on energy efficiency and aerosol formation from the decomposition of gas-phase benzene, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 41, 1, pp. 206-214, (2005); J Inst Electrostat Jpn, (2009); Kim, Hyun-Ha, Effect of different catalysts on the decomposition of VOCs using flow-type plasma-driven catalysis, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, 34, 3 PART 3, pp. 984-995, (2006); Annual Report on the Environment the Sound Material Cycle Society and the Biodiversity in Japan 2009, (2009); Proc Inst Electrostatics, (1995); Mizuno, Akira Q., Basic performance of an electrostatically augmented filter consisting of a packed ferroelectric pellet layer, Journal of Electrostatics, 25, 1, pp. 97-107, (1990)","","","","","","","","13499203; 0386216X","","","","Japanese","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955366088"

The passive adsorption of arthropod-repellent semi-volatiles to neighbouring foliage could convey associational resistance, whereby a plant's neighbours reduce damage caused by herbivores.•We found that birch (Betula spp.) leaves adsorb and re-release the specific arthropod-repelling C<inf>15</inf> semi-volatiles ledene, ledol and palustrol produced by Rhododendron tomentosum when grown in mixed association in a field setup. In a natural habitat, a higher concentration of ledene was released from birches neighbouring R. tomentosum than from birches situated > 5 m from R. tomentosum. Emission of α-humulene, a sesquiterpene synthesized by both Betula pendula and R. tomentosum, was also increased in R. tomentosum-neighbouring B. pendula.•In assessments for associational resistance, we found that the polyphagous green leaf weevils (Polydrusus flavipes) and autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) larvae both preferred B. pendula to R. tomentosum. P. flavipes also preferred birch leaves not exposed to R. tomentosum to leaves from mixed associations. In the field, a reduction in Euceraphis betulae aphid density occurred in mixed associations.•Our results suggest that plant/tree species may be protected by semi-volatile compounds emitted by a more herbivore-resistant heterospecific neighbour. © The Authors (2010).

The discharge of toxic compounds to the atmosphere has been implicitly regarded as a way of removal or destruction. During sewage treatment, the fate mechanism of volatilization/stripping, sorption and biotransformation primarily determines the fate of volatile HAPs. The objectives of this study are to investigate the emission characteristics of HAPs, which are generated from the liquid surface of sewage treatment facilities, by using an emission isolation flux chamber. HAP emissions increased at the inlet of the aerobic chamber during summer due to the relatively high atmospheric temperature. The percent ratio of flux for toluene reached its peak in winter, accounting for 33.6-34.2% of the total, but decreased to 25.1-28.6% in summer. In autumn, trichloroethene (TCE) was the highest, recording 17.6-18.1%, with chloroform and toluene showing similar levels. It seems that the ratio of chlorinated hydrocarbons increases in both summer and autumn because the chamber temperature during that time is higher than winter. This study is the initial study to investigate the emission characteristics of volatile HAPs emitted from domestic sewage treatment facilities to the air in Korea. Therefore, the isolation flux chamber will be used as an emission estimations tool to measure HAPs from sewage treatment facilities and may be applied to develop the emission factor and national source inventory of HAPs. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Chloroform; Trichloroethanol; Air Pollutants; Hazardous Substances; Sewage; Chlorinated Hydrocarbon; Chloroform; Toluene Derivative; Trichloroethanol; Air Pollutant; Air Pollution Control; Air Temperature; Article; Autumn; Controlled Study; Hazardous Air Pollutant; Korea; Liquid; Priority Journal; Sewage Treatment; Summer; Winter; Air Pollutants; Hazardous Substances; Sewage; Waste Management","chlorinated hydrocarbon; chloroform; toluene derivative; trichloroethanol; air pollutant; air pollution control; air temperature; article; autumn; controlled study; hazardous air pollutant; Korea; liquid; priority journal; sewage treatment; summer; winter; Air Pollutants; Hazardous Substances; Sewage; Waste Management","","chloroform, 67-66-3; trichloroethanol, 115-20-8; Air Pollutants, 0; Hazardous Substances, 0; Sewage, 0","","undefined, (1998); Namkung, Eun, ESTIMATING VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND EMISSIONS FROM PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS., Journal of the Water Pollution Control Federation, 59, 7, pp. 670-678, (1987); Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from Sewage Treatment Facilities, (1987); Eiip Vol II, (1997); Sampling for Measurement of Odours, (2025); Voc Emissions from Wastewater Treatment Plants Characterization Control and Compliance, (2002); Landfill Gas Emissions, (1992); undefined, (2010); Jayanty U S EPA 600 S3 89 008, (1989); Wang, Leping, Sorption of Toxic Organic Compounds on Wastewater Solids: Mechanism and Modeling, Environmental Science and Technology, 27, 1, pp. 152-158, (1993)","","","","","","","","14640333; 14640325","","JEMOF","20383371","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950851516"

Increasing net waste generation rates within U.S. metropolitan centers, skyrocketing transportation costs for waste hauling, and the enticement of increased electrical revenues from 'green' power sources all amplify the need for better technologies. Written by an internationally renowned expert with fifty years of experience, Combustion and Incineration Processes: Applications in Environmental Engineering, Fourth Edition has been updated to reflect the latest advances in the field, keeping pace with the evolution of complex and interdisciplinary technology that can better the environment. Detailing the changes that have occurred since the previous editions appeared, this volume's expanded scope includes additional details, data, and graphics regarding the design and operational characteristics of municipal and industrial waste incineration and conversion systems and numerous refinements in associated pollution control. The book offers a thorough overview of: Design, operation, and evaluation of incineration and conversion (gasification) systems for hazardous and non-hazardous gaseous, liquid, biosolid, and solid wastes; the waste management facility, from contaminant receipt, materials handling, and storage to stack discharge and dispersion; breakthroughs in air pollution control; waste and residue characteristics; and advances in materials handling, waste processing, refractory and materials engineering, combustion technology, and energy recovery to reduce and control toxins and pollutants in the environment. Achievement of true Zero Waste, or the eradication of landfills, will likely require thermal processing to economically extract the ultimate useful value from waste residue after minimization, reuse, and recycling. The latest technical advances continue to evolve and attract increased attention, and this book provides the requisite technical education and guidance to those responsible for selection and procurement of these new systems"". © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Chemistry of Coal Utilization, (1963); Environ Sci Tech, (1972); Perry S Chemical Engineers Handbook, (1997); Ashre Handbook, (1974); J Res Natl Bur Stand, (1939); Thermochemistry of the Chemical Substances, (1936); International Critical Tables, (1929); Z Phys Chem, (1889); Hottel, Hoyt Clarke, Kinetic studies in stirred reactors: Combustion of carbon monoxide and propane, Symposium (International) on Combustion, 10, 1, pp. 111-121, (1965); Combustion of Methane in A Jet Mixed Reactor, (1967)","","CRC Press","","","","","","","9781439875582; 9781439805039","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115966012"

It was reviewed that only reactor material was an independent variable among the potential control factors concerned. It was also suggested that main mechanism by EB should be radical reaction for the VOC removal rather than that by primary electrons. It was discussed that the removal efficiency of benzene was lower than that of hexane due to a closed benzene ring. In the case of aromatic VOCs, it was observed that the decomposition of the VOCs with more functional groups attached on the benzene ring was much easier than those with less ones. As for aliphatic VOCs, it was also implied that the longer carbon chain was, the higher the removal efficiency became. An EB-catalyst hybrid system was discussed as an alternative way to remove VOCs more effectively than EB-only system due to much less by-products.

Carbon disulfide is a chemical of widespread use both in the past and in the present. Its industry demand has dramatically changed over the last two decades and is expected to grow in future in step with those industries involving fibre, mining, rubber products, and the agro-chemical sector. This compound, classified as a hazardous air pollutant about 20 years ago, has been re-appraised, as increasingly restrictive pollution standards are expected to be introduced. An array of physical-chemical technologies for treating CS <inf>2</inf> containing air are already in use, but they have a series of drawbacks, such as high energy consumption (incineration, thermal oxidation), the immobilization of the contaminant solely from one phase to another (adsorption), and the generation of secondary by-products that require additional treatment (hydrolysis). Thus, technological research on affordable processing alternatives is of considerable interest for related industries using or producing CS<inf>2</inf>. The biological technologies whose efficiency is based on the activity of microorganisms to biodegrade air pollutants overcome many of the disadvantages of conventional techniques and are especially useful for the removal of relatively low concentrations of pollutants. In this paper, the main properties, sources, and uses of CS<inf>2</inf> are summarized, and alternative biotreatments for CS<inf>2</inf> are reviewed. Several applications of the technical and economical feasibility of biofilters and biotrickling filters are shown, although their widespread industrial application still requires further research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution Control; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Carbon Disulfide; Industrial Emissions; Air Pollution; Air Pollution Control; Biofilters; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Energy Utilization; Industrial Applications; Industrial Emissions; Industry; Waste Incineration; Additional Treatment; Bio-trickling Filters; Biological Technology; Conventional Techniques; Economical Feasibility; Hazardous Air Pollutants; High Energy Consumption; Technological Researches; Carbon Disulfide","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Biofilters; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Energy utilization; Industrial applications; Industrial emissions; Industry; Waste incineration; Additional treatment; Bio-trickling filters; Biological technology; Conventional techniques; Economical feasibility; Hazardous air pollutants; High energy consumption; Technological researches; Carbon disulfide","","","","American Conference of Industrial Hygienists, (2006); Alberta Ambient Air Quality Objectives, (2005); Alcántara, Sergio, Carbon disulfide oxidation by a microbial consortium from a trickling filter, Biotechnology Letters, 21, 9, pp. 815-819, (1999); Toxicological Profile for Carbon Disulfide, (1996); Carbon Disulfide Fact Sheet, (2005); National Pollutant Inventory Carbon Disulfide Summary all Sources Australia, (2008); Ramírez, Antonio Avalos, Control of methanol vapours in a biotrickling filter: Performance analysis and experimental determination of partition coefficient, Bioresource Technology, 100, 4, pp. 1573-1581, (2009); Barona, Astrid, Biofilter response to gradual and sudden variations in operating conditions, Biochemical Engineering Journal, 22, 1, pp. 25-31, (2004); Bartholomaeus, Andrew, Review of the toxicology of carbonyl sulfide, a new grain fumigant, Food and Chemical Toxicology, 43, 12, pp. 1687-1701, (2005); Chem Biochem Eng Q, (1988)","","National Research Council of Canada","","","","","","12086053; 11818700","","ENRVE","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859737804"

In this review, the recent developments in catalytic combustion of VOCs with regard to active species such as noble metal catalysts, mixed metal oxides, perovskite and spinel metal oxide phases were examined. The effects of particle sizes of active species, catalyst supports, the water vapor effect and the coking effect on catalytic combustion were evaluated. It is found that the research on noble metal catalysts mainly focuses on developing new supports and bi-elemental noble metal catalysts; while the research on non-noble metal catalysts focuses on developing new mixed metal oxides, perovskites and spinel catalysts, as well as investigating the effects of particle sizes and various supports on the combustion activity. Additionally, as far as practical application is concerned, the effect of water vapor and coking deactivation on the catalytic combustion process are discussed. This review will be helpful in choosing an appropriate technique for the removal of VOCs by catalytic combustion with high activity and high stability. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalytic Combustion; Coking Deactivation; Noble Metal; Non-noble Metal; Volatile Organic Compounds","","","","","Catal Today, (2009); Shah, Ramesh K., Opportunities for heat exchanger applications in environmental systems, Applied Thermal Engineering, 20, 7, pp. 631-650, (2000); Santos, S., Treatment of wet process hardboard plant VOC emissions by a pilot scale biological system, Biochemical Engineering Journal, 37, 3, pp. 261-270, (2007); Volatile Organic Compounds in the Atmosphere, (1995); Catal Today, (2004); Ind Eng Chem Res; Everaert, Kim, Catalytic combustion of volatile organic compounds, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 109, 1-3, pp. 113-139, (2004); Appl Catal B, (2023); Appl Catal B, (2003); Appl Catal, (2002)","","Beijing University Press","","","","","","10006818","","","","Chinese","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950355168"

Complete MEK conversion can be achieved for the most concentrated stream (1250 ppmv, WHSV = 425 h-1) at temperatures between 270 °C (manganite) and 345 °C (chromite). Activity is governed by the nature of the cation in position B and related to reducibility, being comparable for manganite activity with that of the much more expensive Pt-supported catalysts. Doping with K of lanthanum manganite produces an increase in surface area, as well as the formation of non-stoichiometric oxygen and a greater proportion of Mn4+ on the surface. All these factors may have a role in increasing its activity for catalytic combustion. Catalytic results suggest a marked influence of MEK concentration on the combustion rate. MEK oxidation to CO<inf>2</inf> goes through acetaldehyde as intermediate product; methyl vinyl ketone and diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) were also formed, albeit in very low amounts. Nevertheless, acetaldehyde yield is zero at complete conversion, so the combustion of MEK can be carried out over these perovskite systems with 100% selectivity for CO<inf>2</inf>. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The zeolite supported metal nanoparticles assisted the discharge plasma to expand over a wide surface area. Among the tested active metals in this study, silver exhibited the most prominent influence in the discharge plasmas on the surface of zeolites. On the other hand, plasma eneration was limited to the edges of the zeolites when the bare zeolites were used. The difference in the shape and the area of the discharge plasma was also found to be correlated with the performance of plasma-catalyst reactor for the decomposition of volatile organic compounds.

The study, based on the analysis of interstitial gases sampled along vertical profiles within the cover soil, was aimed to investigate the VOC behaviour as biogas transits from a reducing to a relatively more oxidizing environment. A total of 48 and 63 different VOCs were identified in the soil and well gases, respectively. Aromatics represent the dominant group (71.5% of total VOC) in soil gases, followed by alkanes (6.8%), ketones (5.7%), organic acids (5.2%), aldehydes (3.0%), esters (2.6%), halogenated compounds (2.1%) and terpenes (1.3%). Cyclics, heterocyclics, S-bearing compounds and phenols are ≤ 1%. In the wells the VOC composition is characterized by higher concentrations of cyclic (7.6%) and S-bearing compounds (2%) and lower concentrations of O-bearing compounds. The vertical distribution of VOCs in the cover soil shows significant variations: alkanes, aromatics and cyclics decrease at decreasing depth, whereas an inverse trend is displayed by the O-bearing species. Total VOC and CH<inf>4</inf> concentrations at a depth of 30 cm in the soil are comparable, inferring that microbial activity is likely affecting VOCs at a very minor extent with respect to CH<inf>4</inf>. According to these considerations, to assess the biogas emission impact, usually carried out on the sole basis of CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> emission rates, the physical-chemical behaviour of VOCs in the cover soil, regulating the discharge of these highly contaminant compounds in ambient air, has to be taken into account. The soil vertical distribution of these species can be used to better evaluate the efficiency of oxidative capability of intermediate and final covers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Non-thermal plasma (NTPs) chemistry is an innovative tool for potentially abating environmental pollutants; this technology promises to meet a host of abatement demands, including those mentioned above, and also offers crucial advantages such as improved energy efficiency, higher levels of treatment in smaller spaces, and near zero-emissions. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Environmental Pollutants; Organic Chemicals; Organic Compound; Article; Chemistry; Ecosystem Restoration; Indoor Air Pollution; Instrument Sterilization; Isolation And Purification; Methodology; Odor; Pollutant; Quality Of Life; Waste Disposal; Water Management; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Remediation; Odors; Organic Chemicals; Quality Of Life; Refuse Disposal; Sterilization; Water Purification","organic compound; article; chemistry; ecosystem restoration; indoor air pollution; instrument sterilization; isolation and purification; methodology; odor; pollutant; quality of life; waste disposal; water management; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Remediation; Odors; Organic Chemicals; Quality of Life; Refuse Disposal; Sterilization; Water Purification","","Environmental Pollutants, 0; Organic Chemicals, 0","The authors are grateful to Professor L.

The reaction rate constants of various pollutants were obtained by substituting the decomposition experimental data reported from literature into the model equation. The result showed that under different conditions of discharge mode, electrode structure, and operation parameters, the decomposition reaction rate constants were almost unchanged for the same pollutant, which proved that the model had wide applicability and was independent of the discharge mode and reactor structure. The reaction rate constants of pollutants could be classified according to their molecular structure. Then the relationship between reaction rate constant and the dissociation energy of the easiest dissociating chemical bond (EDCB) in pollutant molecule was discussed. It was found that the reaction rate constants of pollutants with lower dissociation energy of EDCB were larger than those of pollutants with a steady structure and higher dissociation energy of EDCB. For example, sulfide, amine, alkene and substituted alkene had much larger reaction rate constants (about 10-2 m3·W-1·h-1) than aromatics, alkane and substituted alkane (10-4-10-3 m3·W-1·h-1). © All Rights Reserved. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decomposition; Gaseous Pollutant; Non-equilibrium Plasma; Reaction Kinetics Model; Reaction Rate Constant; Decomposition Reaction; Discharge Mode; Dissociation Energies; Electrode Structure; Experimental Data; Gaseous Pollutant; Gaseous Pollutants; Model Equations; Non-equilibrium Plasma; Nonequilibrium Plasmas; Operation Parameters; Pollutant Molecules; Reaction Kinetics Model; Substituted Alkene; Amines; Association Reactions; Chemical Bonds; Dissociation; Electric Discharges; Fog; Free Radical Polymerization; Olefins; Paraffins; Plasmas; Pollution; Reaction Kinetics; Rate Constants","Decomposition reaction; Discharge mode; Dissociation energies; Electrode structure; Experimental data; Gaseous pollutant; Gaseous pollutants; Model equations; Non-equilibrium plasma; Nonequilibrium plasmas; Operation parameters; Pollutant molecules; Reaction kinetics model; Substituted alkene; Amines; Association reactions; Chemical bonds; Dissociation; Electric discharges; Fog; Free radical polymerization; Olefins; Paraffins; Plasmas; Pollution; Reaction kinetics; Rate constants","","","","Yu, Qi, Simulation of NO removal by using pulsed discharge, Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal, 59, 1, pp. 195-200, (2008); Mok, Young Sun, Mathematical analysis of positive pulsed corona discharge process employed for removal of nitrogen oxides, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, 26, 5, pp. 1566-1574, (1998); Mok, Young Sun, Removal of NO and formation of byproducts in a positive-pulsed corona discharge reactor, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 39, 10, pp. 3938-3944, (2000); Korean Soc Atmos Environ, (2000); Mok, Young Sun, Decomposition of volatile organic compounds and nitric oxide by nonthermal plasma discharge processes, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, 30, 1 III, pp. 408-416, (2002); Sun, Wanming, Non-thermal plasma remediation of SO2/NO using a dielectric-barrier discharge, Journal of Applied Physics, 79, 7, pp. 3438-3444, (1996); Helfritch, Dennis J., Pulsed corona discharge for hydrogen sulfide decomposition, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 29, 5, pp. 882-886, (1993); Koutsospyros, Agamemnon D., Plasmochemical degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in a capillary discharge plasma reactor, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, 33, 1 I, pp. 42-49, (2005); undefined, (2008); Acta Scientiae Circumstantiate, (2004)","","","","","","","","04381157","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67549083468"

Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) produces non-thermal plasma to remove toluene using high frequency alternating current (AC). Based on the elements of circuit and DBD, the effects of reactor structure, voltage, frequency and power on removal efficiency of toluene were tested. The byproducts and decomposition mechanism of toluene were analyzed. The experimental results show the 99-ceramic reactor of DBD is helpful for toluene removal than the quartz glass reactor. The frequency and power are nonlinearly related with the removal efficiency. If harmonic frequency occurs, the highest power belongs to reactor, and removal efficiency reaches its maximum value.

The gases covered include NO, NO<inf>2</inf>, HONO, HNO<inf>3</inf>, NH<inf>3</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, DMS, Biogenic VOC, O<inf>3</inf>, CH<inf>4</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O and particles in the size range 1 nm-10 μm including organic and inorganic chemical species. The main focus of the review is on the exchange between terrestrial ecosystems, both managed and natural and the atmosphere, although some new developments in ocean-atmosphere exchange are included. The material presented is biased towards the last decade, but includes earlier work, where more recent developments are limited or absent. New methodologies and instrumentation have enabled, if not driven technical advances in measurement. These developments have advanced the process understanding and upscaling of fluxes, especially for particles, VOC and NH<inf>3</inf>. Examples of these applications include mass spectrometric methods, such as Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (AMS) adapted for field measurement of atmosphere-surface fluxes using micrometeorological methods for chemically resolved aerosols. Also briefly described are some advances in theory and techniques in micrometeorology. For some of the compounds there have been paradigm shifts in approach and application of both techniques and assessment. These include flux measurements over marine surfaces and urban areas using micrometeorological methods and the up-scaling of flux measurements using aircraft and satellite remote sensing. The application of a flux-based approach in assessment of O<inf>3</inf> effects on vegetation at regional scales is an important policy linked development secured through improved quantification of fluxes. The coupling of monitoring, modelling and intensive flux measurement at a continental scale within the NitroEurope network represents a quantum development in the application of research teams to address the underpinning science of reactive nitrogen in the cycling between ecosystems and the atmosphere in Europe. Some important developments of the science have been applied to assist in addressing policy questions, which have been the main driver of the research agenda, while other developments in understanding have not been applied to their wider field especially in chemistry-transport models through deficiencies in obtaining appropriate data to enable application or inertia within the modelling community. The paper identifies applications, gaps and research questions that have remained intractable at least since 2000 within the specialized sections of the paper, and where possible these have been focussed on research questions for the coming decade. © 2009. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biogenic Emissions; Compensation Points; Dry Deposition; Resuspension; Trace Gas Fluxes; Acetaldehyde; Acetone; Ammonia; Methanol; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen Oxide; Sulfur Dioxide; Aerosols; Ecosystems; Fighter Aircraft; Gas Emissions; Inorganic Chemicals; Mass Spectrometry; Nitric Acid; Remote Sensing; Biogenic Emission; Compensation Points; Dry Deposition; Re-suspension; Trace Gas; Atmospheric Composition; Acetaldehyde; Acetone; Ammonia; Isoprenoid; Methanol; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen Oxide; Reactive Nitrogen Species; Sesquiterpene; Snow; Sulfur Dioxide; Terpene; Volatile Agent; Aerosol Composition; Atmospheric Chemistry; Biogenic Emission; Chemical Composition; Compensation; Dry Deposition; Literature Review; Micrometeorology; Nitrogen Oxides; Numerical Model; Paradigm Shift; Resuspension; Surface Flux; Trace Gas; Volatile Organic Compound; Aerosol; Air Pollution Control; Atmosphere; Atmospheric Deposition; Canopy; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Planning; Environmental Sustainability; Grassland; Land Biome; Mass Spectrometry; Meteorology; Particle Size; Priority Journal; Quantitative Analysis; Review; Statistical Model; Vegetation","Aerosols; Ecosystems; Fighter aircraft; Gas emissions; Inorganic chemicals; Mass spectrometry; Nitric acid; Remote sensing; Biogenic emission; Compensation points; Dry deposition; Re-suspension; Trace gas; Atmospheric composition; acetaldehyde; acetone; ammonia; isoprenoid; methanol; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxide; reactive nitrogen species; sesquiterpene; snow; sulfur dioxide; terpene; volatile agent; aerosol composition; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; chemical composition; compensation; dry deposition; literature review; micrometeorology; nitrogen oxides; numerical model; paradigm shift; resuspension; surface flux; trace gas; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air pollution control; atmosphere; atmospheric deposition; canopy; climate change; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental sustainability; grassland; land biome; mass spectrometry; meteorology; particle size; priority journal; quantitative analysis; review; statistical model; vegetation","","acetaldehyde, 75-07-0; acetone, 67-64-1; ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; methanol, 67-56-1; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the European Commission for the ACCENT, NitroEurope and GRAMINAE projects, from COST for ACTION 729 and the European Science Foundation for the Nitrogen in Europe (NinE) program.

Conventional methods currently used to treat VOCs include incineration, condensation, adsorption, and absorption. Incineration and condensation are cost-effective only for moderate to high VOC concentrations. Adsorption and absorption do not destroy VOCs but simply transfer them to another medium. The humid gas stream can plug the condenser and can fill up the adsorption site of the adsorbent. However, none of these methods are cost-effective for the treatment of gas streams with low to moderate concentration and having large numbers of compounds, as the recovery and reuse of the compounds is not economically feasible. A host of alternative remediation technologies, which offer a number of advantages over conventional technologies, are emerging. These include treatment of VOCs with spark-generated carbon aerosol particles, negative air ions treatment, treatment using mesoporous chromium oxide and silica fiber matrix, electrical discharge treatment, electron beam bombardment, and ultraviolet (UV) photooxidation mediated by heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. This review discusses these emerging technologies against the backdrop of conventional approaches for VOC treatment.

Isoprene is a ubiquitous BVOC that plays an important role in plant physiology and is also involved in a number of environmentally relevant tropospheric chemistries. The use of membrane introduction tandem mass spectrometry (MIMS-MS/MS) is presented as an on-line analytical technique used to directly monitor the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds in real-time. We present data for the time-resolved emission of isoprene from potato plants (Solanum tuberosum) in response to mechanical wounding and heat stress by continuously monitoring the headspace air of a closed system. We demonstrate as a test case that MIMS- MS/MS is a robust and versatile technique that can be successfully applied as a real-time monitor for trace level (ppbv) biogenic volatile organic compound emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Monitoring; Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds; Membrane Introduction Mass Spectrometry; Mims; Tandem Mass Spectrometry","","","","","Science, (2006); Runyon, Justin B., Volatile chemical cues guide host location and host selection by parasitic plants, Science, 313, 5795, pp. 1964-1967, (2006); Kesselmeier, Jürgen, Biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC): An overview on emission, physiology and ecology, Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry, 33, 1, pp. 23-88, (1999); Turlings, T.

The activity of LaMnO<inf>3</inf>-based catalyst was very high in the oxidation of each compound tested. The Ag-doped catalyst was the most active in the oxidation of each compound and it displayed the highest BET specific surface area (SSA) also. The influence of Pt or Pd doping on perovskite activity is negligibly small. Pt-doped catalysts are slightly more active while Pd-doped catalysts are slightly less active than the pure perovskite. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) for the catalyst precursor indicates that above 500 °C a perovskite structure began to form.

The use of a catalyst bed in theory allows VOC destruction to occur at lower temperatures than would otherwise be required if an afterburner was employed. Regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTO) were installed in multiple applications in all its refineries. RTOs allows exhaust gases exiting the RTOs to be only 50°C higher than the feed temperature, although the combustion process itself occurs at 850°C.

The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon. Textural analysis by N<inf>2</inf> sorption revealed that were obtained porous materials. The La-Fe zirconia catalyst resisted the high concentration trichloroethylene flow and kept its activity as the temperature was increased.

Microorganisms degrade the VOCs to harmless products such as carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>), biomass and water. In spite of the advantages, significant unresolved challenges remain for biological waste gas treatment. Fluctuating loads in waste gas streams, especially of VOCs with low water solubility, can often not be satisfactorily removed. Concentration peaks leave the reactor virtually untreated, while periods without VOCs in the waste gas lead to starvation of the bacteria. Furthermore, bioreactors are often subject to clogging due to biomass accumulation. In the current work, a flat sheet membrane bioreactor was developed which was able to buffer fluctuating loads of toluene, our model compound, by absorption in silicone oil prior to degradation and which continuously removed and discharged excess biomass from the reactor. The absorption and the biodegradation were both membrane based. An inverse bacterial biofilm developed on the membrane, which separated the culture medium from the absorbent. The culture medium was constantly passed along the biofilm, introducing shear stresses on the surface and thereby removing excess, inactive biomass. The toluene surface elimination capacity was virtually independent of the gas flow rate for the tested steady-state conditions and reached a maximum of 0.6 g m-2h-1. Experiments with fluctuating inlet mass flow rates of toluene confirmed the excellent buffering capability of the set-up.

This cover is effective to blocking VOCs out. However the problem is the way to treat VOCs after blocking. BET process is continuous process which means consecutive generating of VOCs. For this, we installed catalytic oxidation furnace to burn VOCs. This set is composed of VOCs blower, heat exchanger, burner, catalytic oxidizer and stack. VOCs blower take off-gas from BET to the catalytic oxidation furnace. The next stage is heat exchanging between off-gas and waste gas after oxidation. After this stage, off-gas was pre-heated over 200!. Next, preheated gas charges to the catalytic oxidation furnace after burning. Catalytic oxidation temperature is about 300!. Catalytic oxidation furnace uses HHD (Halohydrocarbon & VOC Destruction Catalysts). This catalyst shape is similar to honey comb. Honey comb base structure is made up of Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> attaching Platinum catalyst which has strong absorption power. From this oxidation process, VOCs was removed about 90% of whole off-gas. We installed 2 sets of catalytic oxidation furnace and 29 number of BET cover. Optimizing new technology to our facility, we need to spend cost for utility and catalyst. However, compare to other technology like regenerative catalytic oxidation and high temperature oxidation, low temperature oxidation is more economical. The reason is pre-heating stage before oxidation. Oxidation needs Coke Oven Gas for heating source. But, preheating stage decreases using amount of COG(Coke Oven Gas). © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bet; Catalyst; Catalytic Oxidation; Low Temperature Oxidation; Vocs; Catalytic Oxidation; Coke; Effluents; Heating; Low Temperature Operations; Ovens; Catalytic Oxidizers; Low Temperature Oxidation; Waste Gas; Volatile Organic Compounds","Catalytic oxidation; Coke; Effluents; Heating; Low temperature operations; Ovens; Catalytic oxidizers; Low temperature oxidation; Waste gas; Volatile organic compounds","","","","undefined, (2007); undefined, (2008); Iron Steel Conference of Posco, (2004); undefined, (2008)","","","","","","","","01295721","","SEQUD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38549171335"

The PXRD and FTIR analyses reveal that the pillaring has been taken place in the interlayer of the layered materials. All the catalysts were found to be mesoporous in nature. The number of reducing sites was found to be higher than that of oxidizing sites. With increase in the calcination temperature of 5 wt% Fe(III)/TiP, surface area and surface oxygen increase up to 300 °C, thereafter exhibits a slow decrease up to 500 °C. But the oxidizing and reducing properties go on decreasing with activation temperature. Catalytic decomposition of acetone, methanol, diethyl ether and 2-propanol as probe molecules was studied to find out the suitability of the material for VOCs decomposition reactions. Fe(III) pillared TiP (5 wt%) with high iron content, surface area and surface oxygen shows higher catalytic activity towards the complete decomposition of VOCs. Titanium phosphate pillared with 5 wt% Fe(III), calcined at 300 °C showed complete decomposition of VOCs in the range of 180-350 °C. The catalytic activity of these materials is comparable with other reported catalysts. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

First, the predominant emission sources for these compounds are identified within a P&P or WP mill, followed by a discussion of the widely tested control technologies. A fair amount of the experience with technologies is from a lateral transfer from applications to boilers operating mainly in the electric utility industry. For SO <inf>2</inf> emission control for boilers, besides substitution of lower sulphur fuels and capture within the combustion process itself by alkaline constituents of the fuel, end-of-pipe control technologies involve several mature flue gas desulphurization technologies. Control of H <inf>2</inf>SO <inf>4</inf> aerosols from combustion is relatively difficult and limited experience has been gained with candle filters and wet electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). For NO <inf>x</inf> emission control, besides switching to lower nitrogen fuels such as oils, control technologies applicable to fossil fuel-fired boilers are also fairly advanced and include both combustion modifications and end-of-pipe technologies like selective non-catalytic reduction and selective catalytic reduction. NO <inf>x</inf> control for wood-fired and combination wood-fired boilers is difficult to achieve since the wood N content governs the NO <inf>x</inf> emissions, and post-combustion NO <inf>x</inf> control is generally only effective on ""base-loaded"" boilers. NO <inf>x</inf> emission control for kraft recovery furnaces is mainly obtained by maximizing the principle of staged combustion, while NO <inf>x</inf> emission control techniques for kraft lime kilns are still in their infancy. Regenerative thermal oxidizers and regenerative catalytic oxidizers are the dominant VOC reduction technologies in the WP sectors. VOC reduction in kraft P&P mills is mostly brought about by incinerating NCGs in boilers, kilns and thermal oxidizers. ClO <inf>2</inf> is controlled quite effectively with wet scrubbers with scrubbing media ranging from chilled water to alkaline medium with and without sulphides and sulphites. Particulate matter emissions, including total PM, PM <inf>10</inf>, and PM <inf>2.5</inf>, from P&P and WP facility sources are controlled by a range of control devices including ESPs, fabric filters, venturi scrubbers and multiclones. The control of minute quantities of dioxins and furans that result from combustion of just about any fuel with some chloride content is a continuously evolving art form. Current understanding focuses on three important principles: a) minimize products of incomplete combustion, b) minimize extraneous sources of chloride in the boiler fuel mix, and c) minimize the residence time spent by flue gases in the temperature range of 250 and 400°C where maximum ""de novo"" formation is believed to occur. TRS emissions, comprised essentially of the four reduced sulphur compounds (RSCs) H <inf>2</inf>S, CH <inf>3</inf>SH, (CH <inf>3</inf>) <inf>2</inf>S and (CH <inf>3</inf>) <inf>2</inf>S <inf>2</inf>, from kraft pulping and recovery sources are mainly controlled by incineration. TRS emission control from recovery furnaces, lime kilns and smelt dissolving tanks is accomplished chiefly by process control. Other TRS control technologies include scrubbing, which only addresses the acidic RSCs. The control of greenhouse gases, principally CO <inf>2</inf>, is mainly concerned with improving the overall energy efficiency of the process. Control of mercury emissions revolves around oxidizing the elemental mercury and removing the oxidized species in wet scrubbers or by injecting activated carbon in the flue gas stream to capture the Hg prior to the PM control device. © 2007 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boilers; Clo 2; Co 2; Control Technologies; Formation; Furnaces; Ghgs; Lime Kilns; Mercury; No X; Pm; Pulp And Paper; Sulphur Dioxide; Sulphuric Acid; Trs; Vocs; Wood Products","","","","","Proceedings of the 1998 International Gas Research Conference, (1998); Abrams, Richard C., Permitting, startup, and repermitting of the wood waste cogeneration boiler at Kimberly-Clark, Everett, Washington, TAPPI Proceedings - Environmental Conference & Exhibit, 2, pp. 587-598, (1998); Pulp and Paper, (2001); 2000 Statistics of Paper Paperboard and Wood Pulp Data Through 1999, (2000); Calpuff Modeling System, (2004); Pulp and Paper Canada, (1993); Annual Report Center for Air Toxic Metals Catm, (2004); Recommended Good Practice for the Thermal Oxidation of Waste Streams in A Black Liquor Recovery Boiler, (1999); undefined, (2007); Bosch, Hans, CATALYTIC REDUCTION OF NITROGEN OXIDES: A REVIEW ON THE FUNDAMENTALS AND TECHNOLOGY., Catalysis Today, 2, 4, (1988)","","","","","","","","","","","","French","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35748942546"

For comparison, another laboratory-scale plasma-catalysis system was set up and four kinds of metal oxides, i.e., copper oxide, iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and manganese oxide supported on alumina/nickel foam (NF), were used as catalysts. The reaction mechanism and dynamics analysis on toluene removal were suggested. In addition, the characterization of the catalysts was performed by BET, XRD, SEM, FT-IR, and EDS. It has been found that adding argon in the background gas could improve the toluene removal efficiency significantly in the plasma system. Combining plasma with catalyst in situ could improve the toluene removal efficiency, increase the carbon dioxide selectivity and suppress byproducts formation. In addition, manganese oxide/alumina/NF was confirmed as the most effective catalyst for toluene removal. The XRD and SEM results showed that the proportion of metal oxide increased while aluminate decreased after plasma application. The granularity of the grain on the catalyst surface became smaller and the distribution became more uniform after discharge. The results of FT-IR and EDS suggested that some organic compounds deposited on the catalysts after plasma reaction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TPPBs are constructed by adding a non-aqueous phase (e.g. hexadecane, silicone oil) to an aqueous phase that contains the microorganisms responsible for degrading the VOCs. Presence of a water-immiscible phase improves the transfer of hydrophobic substrates (e.g. hexane, oxygen) or reduces the toxicity of inhibitory substances (e.g. benzene, toluene) to the microorganisms present in the aqueous phase. The non-aqueous phase is selected based on cost, safety, good partitioning properties towards the target pollutants, biocompatibility, and non-biodegradability. TPPBs have hitherto been designed as laboratory-scale well-mixed stirred-tank reactors or as biofilters that contain a non-aqueous phase. Scale-up and industrial use of TPPBs require elucidation and modeling of the mechanisms of substrate transfer and uptake; understanding of the mechanisms of microbial selection; identification or synthesis of new inexpensive and robust non-aqueous phases; and generation of suitable guidelines for process design and control. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The calcined and uncalcined samples were characterized by PXRD, FTIR, TG-DTA, BET-surface area, pore size distribution, surface oxygen, surface oxidizing and reducing sites. The PXRD and FTIR analyses support that the pillaring has been taken place in the interlayer of the layered materials. All the catalysts were found to be mesoporous in character. The number of reducing sites was found to be higher than that of oxidizing sites. With increase in the calcination temperature of 15 wt% Mn(III)/TiP, surface area and surface oxygen increase up to 300 °C, thereafter exhibits slow decrease up to 500 °C. But the oxidizing and reducing properties go on decreasing with activation temperature. Catalytic decomposition of acetone, methanol, diethyl ether and 2-propanol was studied to find out the suitability of the material for VOCs decomposition reactions. Mn(III) pillared TiP (15 wt%) with high manganese content, surface area, surface oxygen shows higher catalytic activity towards the complete decomposition of VOCs. Time-on-stream (TOS) experiments justify the stability of the catalysts at least 24 h with minor change in the activity. Titanium phosphate pillared with 15 wt% Mn(III) and calcined at 300 °C showed complete decomposition of VOCs in the range of 180-290 °C. The catalytic activity of these materials is comparable with other reported catalysts. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Oxidation of these reduced sulfur compounds in polluted atmospheres and hence the decrease of their harmful and malodorous effects is thus a matter of concern in numerous industrial and water treatment plants. Photocatalytic treatment of gaseous flow polluted by these sulfur compounds has been actively investigated for the last few years. The first part of the paper is devoted to a literature review on the different TiO<inf>2</inf>-based photocatalytic processes designed for the oxidation of these gaseous compounds. The comparison of their efficiency is done according to the process parameters: batch or flow reactors, photocatalytic materials, residence time, gas flow, pollutant nature and concentration, relative humidity, .... Special attention is paid to the poisoning of the photocatalytic material and to its possible recycling. In the second part of the paper, alternative materials based on aromatic photosensitizers (9,10-dicyanoanthracene, 9,10-anthraquinone) deposited or grafted on silica matrices are then presented and their efficiency compared to more conventional TiO<inf>2</inf>-based materials. It is demonstrated that the oxidation products are totally different from those obtained with TiO<inf>2</inf>. With the photosensitizing materials, singlet oxygen addition is shown to be the major pathway, leading to sulfoxide and sulfone starting from DMS and to methyl methanethiosulfonate starting from DMDS. With TiO<inf>2</inf>-based materials, in the absence of water and hence of hydroxyl radicals, products arising of C{single bond}S and S{single bond}S bond cleavage are mainly obtained: disulfide from DMS and CH<inf>3</inf>SSSCH<inf>3</inf> together with CH<inf>3</inf>SCH<inf>2</inf>SSCH<inf>3</inf> from DMDS. These latter products may be accounted for by electron transfer from sulfide or disulfide to photogenerated holes, leading to radical mechanisms. Mineralization to CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O is also shown to occur with DMS, but is not favoured under these conditions, due to the absence of water and of a too fast gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). The advantages-drawbacks of the two kinds of materials are presented. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Special attention has been paid to the agglomeration of the photocatalysts in form of pellets, to the study of the effect of introducing some carbonaceous materials into the catalyst composition and to comparison with commercial photocatalysts. Our results show that P25 exhibits the best activity among all the studied materials. However, activity importantly decreases when agglomerating the photocatalysts in form of pellets, either with or without carbon addition. The type of carbon material used in the photocatalyst strongly affects propene activity. Thus, carbon materials combining high surface area and high electric conductivity enhance the photocatalyst performance and photocatalyst pellets have been prepared exceeding the activity of a carbon-containing commercial photocatalyst. The importance of the UV-source has been highlighted, showing the 257.7 nm peak radiation much better results than the 365 nm UV-light. The studied photocatalysts are very interesting for propene oxidation not only because of their high activity, but also because it remains constant for more than 40 h and total mineralization of the oxidised propene to carbon dioxide and water is achieved. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the effectiveness of PCO in treating emissions from wastewater treatment plants and landfill facilities. To determine the effectiveness of the process, it is necessary to determine the PCO destruction rates of various volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) species associated with these sources. The destruction rates and other data obtained from such kinetic experiments aid optimal reactor design. Accordingly, reaction rate constants were determined for photocatalytic destruction of methane, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and carbonyl sulfide over a titanium dioxide (TiO<inf>2</inf>) catalyst in a continuous mixed-batch reactor. The PCO destruction rates indicated first order decay for all the components under review. Destruction rates were higher for smaller molecules such as methane and carbonyl sulfide and lower for complex molecules such as xylenes. The destruction rate also depended on humidity in an exponential relationship. The research concludes that PCO is a promising method to treat emissions from wastewater treatment plants and landfills. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonyl Sulfide; Emissions; Landfill; Methane; Odor; Pco; Reaction Rate Constant; Toxic; Uv; Voc; Wastewater Treatment Plant; Xylene; Batch Reactors; Land Fill; Methane; Molecules; Odors; Particulate Emissions; Rate Constants; Reaction Rates; Reclamation; Sewage Pumping Plants; Sulfur Compounds; Toxicity; Volatile Organic Compounds; Waste Management; Waste Treatment; Water Treatment Plants; Xylene; Carbonyl Sulfide; Pco; Toxic; Uv; Wastewater Treatment Plants; Wastewater Treatment","Batch reactors; Land fill; Methane; Molecules; Odors; Particulate emissions; Rate constants; Reaction rates; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sulfur compounds; Toxicity; Volatile organic compounds; Waste management; Waste treatment; Water treatment plants; Xylene; Carbonyl sulfide; PCO; Toxic; UV; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment","","","","Sattler, Melanie L., Method for predicting photocatalytic oxidation rates of organic compounds, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 53, 1, pp. 3-12, (2003); Journal of the Institution of Engineers Singapore, (2005); Journal of the Air Waste Management Association, (1998); Sciencedirect Building and Environmental, (2003); Gogate, Parag R., A review of imperative technologies for wastewater treatment I: Oxidation technologies at ambient conditions, Advances in Environmental Research, 8, 3-4, pp. 501-551, (2004); Disdier, Jean, Measuring the effect of photocatalytic puriﬁers on indoor air hydrocarbons and carbonyl pollutants, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 55, 1, pp. 88-96, (2005); Pco","","Air and Waste Management Association info@awma.org","3M; Alcoa; Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD); Amec; Calgon Carbon Corporation; et al.","100th Annual Conference and Exhibition of the Air and Waste Management Association 2007, ACE 2007","","Pittsburgh; PA; David L.

Over the past 10 years, ozone technology has made the cross-over to the environmental remediation industry creating a viable and cost effective option for the in-situ destruction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil and groundwater. Ozone works by oxidizing and breaking the bonds of targeted VOC(s) such as methylene tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The ozone oxidizes the dissolved-phase MTBE, the primary constituent of concern at the study site, and creates an oxygen-rich environment that encourages microbial degradation of MTBE breakdown products such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF). The byproducts of complete oxidation and microbial degradation of MTBE in groundwater include carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) and water (H<inf>2</inf>O). The study site is a former aggregate mining facility located in Southern California that operated several diesel and gasoline fuel tanks until the late 1990s for fueling facility vehicles and cement trucks. Upon removal, it was determined that the tanks and associated product piping had leaked significantly resulting in an approximately 50,000 ft2 (aerial extent) source area with adsorbed- and liquid-phase fuel hydrocarbons, and an approximately 100,000 ft2 MTBE plume that included a small fraction of dissolved-phase BTEX near the source area. Because of a fast-track property transaction, the client preferred remedial options that would meet relatively stringent site cleanup goals within a short timeframe. To address the aggressive remediation schedule and cleanup requirements, Brown and Caldwell implemented a 2-phased approach that included: 1) removal of source area fuel impact by excavation with subsequent soil remediation via biopile treatment, and 2) remediation of dissolved-phase MTBE via ozone sparging. The objective of the source area removal was to remediate adsorbed-and liquia-phase hydrocarbons and reduce further impacts to groundwater via leaching. Source area removal resulted in the excavation of nearly 50,000 cubic yards (yd3) of soil. Out of the total 50,000 yd3, 17,000 yd3 was considered impacted and was staged for passive remediation in a series of 17-1,000 yd3 ""biopiles"" or treatment cells. The objective of the ozone sparging phase is to restore groundwater quality to regulatory-imposed standards within 7 months to expedite property reclamation and transfer. The remediation network includes 16 sparge wells constructed with ozone diffusers to reduce bubble size and maximize surface area contact. The ozone system will deliver timed pulses of ozone to each of the 16 well circuits to provide optimal contact time and destruction efficiency. Based on the extent of dissolved-phase hydrocarbon fuel, Brown and Caldwell anticipates delivery of up to 550 pounds of ozone for oxidation of MTBE and BTEX compounds as well as other organic compounds and other oxygen consumers in the subsurface. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alcohols; Antennas; Biodegradation; Byproducts; Carbon Dioxide; Cost Effectiveness; Dissolution; Environmental Technology; Groundwater Pollution; Mining; Ozone; Potable Water; Soil Pollution; Soils; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Biopiles; Microbial Degradation; Ozone Oxidation; Property; Source Area; Study Sites; Tert-butyl Ethers; Wastewater Industry; Water And Wastewater; Water Industries; Groundwater","Alcohols; Antennas; Biodegradation; Byproducts; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Dissolution; Environmental technology; Groundwater pollution; Mining; Ozone; Potable water; Soil pollution; Soils; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Biopiles; Microbial degradation; Ozone oxidation; Property; Source area; Study sites; Tert-butyl ethers; Wastewater industry; Water and wastewater; Water industries; Groundwater","","","","","","Materials Science and Technology","","","","","","","9781604239485","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79551547452"

In the adsorption/oxidation process, the effects of ozone on the adsorption characteristics of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) vapor on activated carbon are investigated. The kinetic parameters of the reaction for MEK vapor and O<inf>3</inf> on activated carbon are also determined. The results show that the destructive efficiencies of MEK by 1000 ppmv O<inf>3</inf> on activated carbon are from 12.4% to 48.5%. From the power law kinetic model, the apparent kinetic constant, k, is obtained with a value of 0.0438 h-1. Moreover, from the analytical results of the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy, E<inf>a</inf>, is found to be 5.12 kcal/mol and the value of rate constant, A, is 189.54 h-1. From the Langmuir-Hishelwood model [Escobar, P., Beroy, Q., Iritia, P.P., Huerta, J.H., 2004. Kinetic Study of the Combustion of Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone over α-Hematite Catalyst. Chem. Eng.

J. 45, 509] in combination with the power law kinetic model or Langmuir-Hishelwood is used to predict the breakthrough curves. The destruction of MEK can be effectively promoted as the bed height of activated carbon and the concentration of ozone increase. When the ozone concentration is increased to 7800 ppmv and the amount of activated carbon is increased to 5 g the destructive efficiency of MEK is still greater than 95% even after a prolonged operational time. From the results of this study, an adsorption process in combination with ozone oxidation shows potential for the control of VOCs and odor. © 2007 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

The performance of the biofiltration of ethanol and toluene was estimated in the presence of the native microorganisms of the material and also after the addition, and a period of acclimatization, of external microorganisms. Modifications of the physical and biological characteristics of the material were studied in order to better understand the process. The influence of biofilter shutdown periods was also considered to evaluate the effect of a period of inactivity on subsequent performances. This study shows that a significant degradation of the pollutants is obtainable provided that the following steps are performed: seeding with activated sludge, introduction of nutrients, and control of the changes in the material characteristics and the bed moisture. During the operation of the fluidized bed biofilter, the moisture of the bed had an important effect on the biofilter performance, but was rather difficult to control because of its dependence on the ambient and inlet air temperatures, which changed during the day and the seasons. During the tests with the batch of sawdust particles used as delivered without any sludge enrichment, a reduction in abatement performances was measured with time. In the case of ethanol alone, for a concentration of 0.02 g.m-3, abatement decreased from 24% to 18% then to 7%. The partial or complete addition of sawdust particles previously activated with sludge significantly enhanced the performance of the biofilter, both for ethanol and toluene pollution. Abatements of ethanol of 85% and 60% were achieved when the sawdust particles were activated by sludge. In contrast, a 5-week shutdown of the reactor produced a decrease in abatement, either by a loss of microorganism efficiency during their ""starvation"" or by their destruction.

The evaluation was unique in that it employed complex mixtures of VOCs commonly found in office buildings at realistically low concentrations. VOC conversion efficiencies varied over a broad range, usually exceeded 20%, and were as high as ~80%. Conversion efficiency generally diminished with increased air flow rate. Significant amounts of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were produced due to incomplete mineralization.

Specifically, the effects of the bioaugment in terms of volatile solids destruction and generation and fate of odor-causing compounds during anaerobic digestion and during storage of the digested biosolids were studied. Two bench-scale anaerobic digesters receiving primary and secondary clarifier biosolids from various full-scale biological wastewater treatment plants were operated.

In addition, the average residual propionic acid concentration in the bioaugmented digester was 54% of that in the control. The monitoring of two organic sulfide compounds, methyl mercaptan (CH<inf>3</inf>SH) and dimethyl sulfide (CH <inf>3</inf>SCH<inf>3</inf>), clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of the bioaugmentation in terms of odor control.

The absence of diffusional limitation and of reaction product effect on the kinetics have both been demonstrated under our working conditions. The influences of concentration, light flux and temperature on the initial degradation rate have been studied. A simple Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model has been verified for TCE and methanol, whereas benzene degradation was more complex and did not follow this simple mechanism.

But all the removal efficiencies were over 98% when an activated carbon fiber (ACF) filter was used downstream from the plasma reactor.

The ACF filter appeared to be co-beneficial in the improvement of removal efficiency, reduction of energy consumption, and the abatement of ozone or other byproducts.

The first material (TiO<inf>2</inf>-QZ) is based on titanium dioxide (TiO<inf>2</inf>) deposited on quartz bars by the sol-gel method. The second one (DCA-SG) is based on the well known photosensitizer, 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA) encapsulated in a sol-gel silica network. In spite of non-optimized conditions, both materials allow the oxidation of DMS in air under irradiation. However, the oxidation products are strikingly different: dimethyldisulfide is the main product detected in the gas phase with TiO<inf>2</inf>-QZ due to a too short residence time to achieve complete mineralization. With DCA-SG no gaseous product is detected in the treated gaseous flow for more than 100 h, due to the exclusive formation of polar dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylsulfone which are totally adsorbed on the highly polar silica gel. The efficiency of this latter reaction depends on the DMS concentration, gas flow and light intensity, but is not affected by the presence of small amounts of water. Singlet oxygen appears to be formed efficiently under these conditions. The saturation of DCA-SG by the oxidation products was demonstrated by several complementary methods, and some possible solutions to regenerate the material are proposed. The complementarities of both TiO<inf>2</inf>-QZ and DCA-SG could be used to achieve the oxidation of different classes of pollutants. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Dimethyl formamide (DMF), major content of solvents, accounts for roughly 2500 tonnes/year to avoid excessive viscosity of polyurea-formaldehyde and to increase facility in working. The other solvent contents, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and toluene, are used as carrier of DMF. Emission of these VOCs from solvent causes serious odor problems. It is important to know the VOCs pollution sources and emission characteristics before treating the VOCs in PU industry. In this study, 80 stacks in five factories were tested to evaluate emission characteristics at each VOCs source. After examining the VOCs concentrations in the flue gases and contents in the PU, the DMF emission rate before treatment and from fugitive source is 2300 and 80 tonnes/year, respectively. To reduce VOCs emission rate, it is important to assess reducing solvent content in painting and increasing control efficiency of treatment equipment. In this study, the zeolite rotator is recommended to be used as effective control equipment. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of oxygen content and gas flow rate were investigated. Under the optimal oxygen content and gas flow rate conditions, the combination effect of DBD and catalyst was observed, and the catalyst before/after discharge was structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). It has been found that combining DBD with catalyst in situ could improve the toluene removal efficiency, increase carbon dioxide selectivity and suppress byproducts formation. Whether the catalyst existed or not, the major products were carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide when oxygen was enough. The characterization of the catalyst suggested that DBD enhanced the dispersion of the active species, increased the stability as well as the activity of the catalyst, and strengthened the oxidation capability of the catalyst, therefore the removal of toluene was promoted. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In operation, the air pollutant formaldehyde was adsorbed from a simulated room (10 m3) onto a slowly rotating honeycomb, which then passed slowly through a small chamber (0.09 m3) in which locally recirculated heated air desorbed the formaldehyde and carried it through a photocatalytic reactor, which oxidized the desorbed material.

The driving force has been public awareness of the need for human health and environmental protection. Consequently, environmental legislation and regulations have been initiated by governments to control air quality. Removing air pollutants, and especially volatile organic compounds (VOC s),from industrial polluted gaseous emissions is achieved by different ways:- Transfer and or concentration of compounds in a liquid phase (condensation, absorption) or onto a solid (adsorption).- Destruction of molecules by thermal oxidation, catalytic treatments, flaring,or degradation of compounds by microorganisms. Among these technologies useful for air treatment, processes involving the biodegradation of pollutants present in the gaseous phase are widely used. They may be applied to both water and air purification (Godish 1997; Liu and Liptak 1997; Heinsohn and Kabel 1999). Thus, these biological systems canre move a large number of molecules, especially volatile organic compounds and odorous molecules. They are generally utilized for the treatment of industrial gaseous emissions. The applications are possible for a concentration of pollutant above 1gm<inf>3</inf> to diluted air (some mg or ?gm<inf>3</inf>). The installation designs cater for an airflow of between 1,000 to 100,000m<inf>3</inf> h<inf>1</inf>, or even more for some systems (Le Cloirec 1998). The principles, processes and modeling of biological systems for air pollution control have been described previously in this book. The objective of this chapter is to present practical approaches to air treatment, especially removal of volatileorganic compounds, by biological methods. Specific points and process examples are developed:- examples and data on the biodegradation of VOC s;- applications of biological processes: general operating conditions and case studies: bio filters, bio trickling filters and bio scrubbers;- treatment of by-products generated by VOC bio treatments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Proc 93rd Annu Meet Exhibition Air and Waste Management Association, (2000); Chou, Ming Shean, Treatment of methylethylketone in air stream by biotrickling filters, Journal of Environmental Engineering (United States), 123, 6, pp. 569-576, (1997); Comiti, Jacques, A new model for determining mean structure parameters of fixed beds from pressure drop measurements: application to beds packed with parallelepipedal particles, Chemical Engineering Science, 44, 7, pp. 1539-1545, (1989); Standard Handbook of Environmental Engineering, (1990); Cotte, F., Absorption of odorous molecules in aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol, Environmental Technology (United Kingdom), 16, 2, pp. 127-136, (1995); Chemical Engineering, (1968); Cox, Huub H.J., Biomass control in waste air biotrickling filters by protozoan predation, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 62, 2, pp. 216-224, (1999); Bioreactors for Waste Gas Treatment, (2001); Guide Du Traitement Des Dechets, (2004); Biofiltration for Air Pollution Control, (1999)","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","","","","","","3540233121; 9783540233121","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84895387972"

Inorganic air pollutants are among those that require special attention because of their significant environmental impacts as well as their lack of response to many physical air pollution control techniques(e.g., filters, vapor capture, and condensation). Many of these inorganic air pollutants (such as hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide) can be associated with severe and acute health impacts following industrial accidents. However, most of the interest in air pollution and health is directed at long-term and low concentration exposure to harmful air contaminants. With the compelling evidence on the long-term impacts of inorganic air pollutants, many researchers have focused on developing and optimizing novel and cost-effective air pollution control strategies that can meet the increasingly stringent regulations on the emissions of these chemicals (e.g., Barnes et al. 1995; Chung et al. 2000;Philip and Deshusses 2003). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Water Environ Technol, (1995); Proceedings of the 88th Annual Meeting Exhibition Air Waste Management Association, (1995); Arp, Daniel J., Molecular biology and biochemistry of ammonia oxidation by Nitrosomonas europaea, Archives of Microbiology, 178, 4, pp. 250-255, (2002); Barnes, Joni M., Removal of nitrogen oxides from gas streams using biofiltration, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 41, 2-3, pp. 315-326, (1995); Burgess, Jo Elizabeth, Developments in odour control and waste gas treatment biotechnology: A review, Biotechnology Advances, 19, 1, pp. 35-63, (2001); Busca, Guido, Abatement of ammonia and amines from waste gases: A summary, Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 16, 2, pp. 157-163, (2003); Choi, Jeong-hak, Removal of ammonia by biofilters: A study with flow-modified system and kinetics, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 53, 1, pp. 92-101, (2003); Chou, Ming Shean, Biotrickling filtration of nitric oxide, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 50, 4, pp. 502-508, (2000); Chung, Yingchien, Biotreatment of ammonia from air by an immobilized Arthrobacter oxydans CH8 biofilter, Biotechnology Progress, 13, 6, pp. 794-798, (1997); Chung, Yingchien, Biotreatment of H2S- and NH3-containing waste gases by co-immobilized cells biofilter, Chemosphere, 41, 3, pp. 329-336, (2000)","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","","","","","","3540233121; 9783540233121","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84895343863"

Results from a series of experiments conducted to evaluate the effect of relative humidity on the degree of load equalization achieved by columns packed with Calgon BPL 4 × 6 mesh activated carbon under intermittent loading conditions where toluene contaminated air was supplied 8 hr/day and uncontaminated air 16 hr/day were described to simulate an industrial process with discontinuous contaminant generation. Experimental testing was conducted for a variety of loading conditions with granular activated carbon column empty bed contact times (EBCT) ranging from 1.5 to 10 sec, influent toluene concentrations as high as 1000 ppm vol, and relative humidity level of 80%. Appreciable load equalization could be accomplished at low EBCT (on the order of a few seconds) even when high relative humidity was present. Implementation of this load equalization approach may facilitate use of smaller, less expensive biofilters, and it had the potential to minimize much of the uncertainty that accompanies biofilter design and operation.

A study on the effectiveness of biofiltration as a control for VOC emissions from a chemical batch processing plant was carried out. The study was conducted over a 12-wk period and designed to evaluate the destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of a biofilter system for methanol, acetone, and toluene with the intent of demonstrating if a biofilter could meet BACT for VOC control. Individual 95% DRE for the overall pilot unit could be consistently achieved for inlet test VOC concentrations above the following levels: methanol 100 ppm vol, acetone 50 ppm vol, and toluene 5 ppm vol. At levels below these, the DRE dropped precipitously with the decreasing inlet concentrations. The pilot unit performed better under daytime and warmer conditions than during nighttime and colder conditions. The daytime/warmer temperature data points for both toluene and acetone suggested that the pilot system was significantly oversized with respect to the overall loading form these two materials. Since the configuration of the biofilters affected the VOC loadings in the bed this, in turn, produced a different overall consumption rate and DRE.

Catalyst characterization was carried out by inductively coupled plasma analysis, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Photocatalytic activity was evaluated for gaseous trichloroethylene (TCE) decomposition in a batch reactor under near-UV irradiation. Both the Ti incorporation method (IMP or CP) and TiO<inf>2</inf> content (4.7-35.0 wt.%) had large effects on structural characteristics and photocatalytic activity of Ti-silicates, whereas no important effects were observed with respect to calcination temperature (200-600°C). At all conditions, TiO<inf>2</inf> was present as pure anatase crystallites with particle diameters in IMP catalysts of 4.4-7.0 nm, being clearly smaller than those in CP ones (12.0-19.6 nm). The ordered structure of the silica was at least partially preserved up to a TiO<inf>2</inf> content of 25 wt.% (CP) and 33 wt.% (IMP). With increasing TiO<inf>2</inf> content, specific surface area (SSA 376-805 m2 g-1) of both CP and IMP catalysts decreased. Similar trends were observed for pore volumes (0.6-1.2 mL g-1) and pore diameters (4.5-7.5 nm) in IMP catalysts. Initial photocatalytic TCE degradation rate constants (0.014-0.202 min-1) obtained with CP catalysts increased systematically with TiO<inf>2</inf> contents up to 35 wt.%, while in IMP ones, they levelled off at TiO<inf>2</inf> contents above 17 wt.%. TCE degradation rates obtained with CP catalysts were up to a factor of six higher than those measured applying the IMP method. This may be explained by a different TiO<inf>2</inf> localization in the silica structure. During IMP preparation, TiO<inf>2</inf> is mostly incorporated within the silica mesopores, whereas during CP synthesis, it is mainly localized on the external silica surface. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The plasma was sustained in a ∼1 mm3 micro reactor, by a voltage of 470 V between the plasma cathode and a planar anode, and at currents ranging from 12 to 22 mA. This direct current glow discharge has been used to study the remediation of methane and benzene, two of the most stable volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The removal fraction for 300-ppm methane in atmospheric pressure air, flowing through the 0.5-mm thick plasma layer, with a residence time of the gas in the plasma of less than 0.5 ms, was measured at 80% with an energy density of 4 kJ/L. For benzene, the remediation rate is as high as 90%, comparable to results obtained with low pressure glow discharges. The energy efficiency for benzene remediation is 0.9 g/kWh, higher than that obtained for benzene remediation in low pressure glow discharges in noble gases. However, the VOC fraction remaining was found to be limited to values of approximately 0.1 and 0.05 for methane and benzene, respectively. In addition to experimental studies, the VOC dissociation mechanism in a VOC/dry air mixture plasma was modeled using a zero-dimensional plasma chemistry code. The modeling results have shown that atomic oxygen impact reactions are the dominant dissociation reactions for VOC destruction in this kind of glow discharge. Diffusion of atomic oxygen to the dielectric wails of the reactor is assumed to cause the observed limitation in the VOC destruction rate and efficiency. © 2005 IEEE. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Pressure Air; Chemical Decontamination; Glow Discharge; Nonthermal Plasma; Volatile Organic Compounds; Atmospheric Pressure; Benzene; Carrier Concentration; Composition Effects; Decontamination; Dissociation; Glow Discharges; Methane; Plasmas; Remediation; Removal; Volatile Organic Compounds; Chemical Decontamination; Direct Current Flow Discharges; Low Pressure Glow Discharges; Nonthermal Plasma; Plasma Cathode; Plasma Applications","Atmospheric pressure; Benzene; Carrier concentration; Composition effects; Decontamination; Dissociation; Glow discharges; Methane; Plasmas; Remediation; Removal; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical decontamination; Direct current flow discharges; Low pressure glow discharges; Nonthermal plasma; Plasma cathode; Plasma applications","","","Manuscript received August 30, 2004; revised January 20, 2005.

When compared to EB-ceramic hybrid under the same existing EB-catalyst conditions, EB-catalyst hybrid has shown a 10% increase in efficiency in toluene treatment at approximately 10 kGy. In the comparison study on the independent effect of EB-catalyst and catalyst itself, the removal efficiency with EB-catalyst revealed a 10% improvement in toluene treatment and an increase of 20% in styrene treatment.

In the PDC reactor, the decomposition efficiency of VOCs was mostly determined by the specific input energy (SIE) and insensitivity to the gas hourly space velocity from 11000 to 55 000h-1. Formic acid (HCOOH) was formed as a common intermediate from the decomposition of the tested aromatic compounds. Formic acid was also found to be an important intermediate for CO<inf>2</inf> formation. Except for styrene, all the tested VOCs indicated zero-order kinetics, which confirm the dominant role of the catalytic reaction in the decomposition of VOCs using the PDC reactor. A simple kinetic model represents well the observed zero-order kinetics with respect to the SIE. Unlike conventional plasma reactors, no correlation between the ionization potential and the decomposition was found with the PDC reactor.

The decomposition of benzene preferentially produced CO<inf>2</inf> and CO, and formic acid as minor one. Carbon balance based on these products was satisfactory at around 100%. For the concentration lower than 110 ppm, the PDC reactor successfully decomposed benzene with specific input energy of around 130 J/l, where the formation of nitrogen oxides was small. The plasma-induced catalytic activity appeared only during plasma application and disappeared as the plasma was turned off. Thermal catalysis showed that temperature was not an important parameter in the decomposition of benzene using the PDC reactor. Comparison of the effects of dilution gases (Ar, N<inf>2</inf>) on the benzene decomposition revealed that the contribution of UV light from the plasma to the activation of Ag/TiO<inf>2</inf> catalyst was negligible. The contribution of catalytic reaction became dominant as increasing specific input energy.

The PCO unit is designed as a regenerable VOC removal system in order to improve the quality of the recirculated air entering the aircraft cabin. The PCO was designed to be a modular unit, with four UV lamps sandwiched between two interchangeable titanium dioxide coated panels. Performances of the PCO unit has been measured in a single pass mode test rig in order to show the ability of the unit to decrease the amount of VOCs (toluene, ethanol, and acetone) entering it (VOCs are fed separately), and in a multipass mode test rig in order to measure the ability of the unit to clean the air of an experimental room polluted with the same VOCs (fed separately). Triangular cell panels have been chosen instead of the wire mesh panels because they have higher efficiency. The efficiency of the PCO unit depends on the type of VOCs that challenges it, toluene being the most difficult one to oxidise. The efficiency of the PCO unit decreases when the air flow rate increases. The multipass mode test results show that the VOCs are oxidized but additional testing time would be necessary in order to show if they can be fully oxidized. The intermediate reaction products are mainly acetaldehyde and formaldehyde whose amount depends on the challenge VOC.

Plants have become larger and are often situated in or close to densely populated areas. Increased hazard of loss of life or property is continually highlighted with incidents such as Flixborough, Bhopal, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, the Phillips 66 incident, and Piper Alpha to name but a few.The field of Loss Prevention is, and continues to, be of supreme importance to countless companies, municipalities and governments around the world, because of the trend for processing plants to become larger and often be situated in or close to densely populated areas, thus increasing the hazard of loss of life or property. This book is a detailed guidebook to defending against these, and many other, hazards. It could without exaggeration be referred to as the ""bible"" for the process industries. This is THE standard reference work for chemical and process engineering safety professionals. For years, it has been the most complete collection of information on the theory, practice, design elements, equipment, regulations and laws covering the field of process safety. An entire library of alternative books (and cross-referencing systems) would be needed to replace or improve upon it, but everything of importance to safety professionals, engineers and managers can be found in this all-encompassing reference instead. Frank Lees' world renowned work has been fully revised and expanded by a team of leading chemical and process engineers working under the guidance of one of the worldâ??s chief experts in this field. Sam Mannan is professor of chemical engineering at Texas A and M University, and heads the Mary Kay Oâ??Connor Process Safety Center at Texas A and M. He received his MS and Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Oklahoma, and joined the chemical engineering department at Texas A and M University as a professor in 1997. He has over 20 years of experience as an engineer, working both in industry and academiaNew detail is added to chapters on fire safety, engineering, explosion hazards, analysis and suppression, and new appendices feature more recent disasters. The many thousands of references have been updated along with standards and codes of practice issued by authorities in the US, UK/Europe and internationally. In addition to all this, more regulatory relevance and case studies have been included in this edition. Written in a clear and concise style, Loss Prevention in the Process Industries covers traditional areas of personal safety as well as the more technological aspects and thus provides balanced and in-depth coverage of the whole field of safety and loss prevention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","undefined; undefined; Lancet, (1915); Lancet, (1915); Lancet, (1915); Br Med J, (1915); Br Med J, (1915); Br Med J, (1915); Lancet, (1915); Br Med J, (1918)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","","9780750675550","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041120899"

A hybrid system coupled to two different techniques, electron beam (EB) and catalyst, was developed to improve the efficiency of the present EB method, to lower the costs of initial investment and management, and to remove by-products efficiently. Various experiments using a pilot system were conducted to increase the removal efficiency of VOC. A removal efficiency > 90% was achieved with an inlet concentration of 1500 ppm C, when 10 kGy was applied to the hybrid system. When toluene (700 ppm C) was treated by the single EB and the hybrid system, the hybrid's efficiency was ∼ 30% higher than that of the single EB under the same conditions of 10 kGy.

The hydrogen-treated catalysts mainly with metallic palladium showed higher oxidation activities than the air-treated catalysts mostly with palladium oxide, even if the palladium oxide was known to be the active phase for high-temperature combustion of methane. The XPS and XRD analyses suggested that the oxidation state of palladium did not change during oxidation reaction at lower temperature of 180°C.

The decomposition of toluene from simulated flue gas was investigated using a pipe electrode with nozzles for the generation of free radicals. Corona characteristics and decomposition of toluene were investigated experimentally. In addition, the decomposition mechanism of toluene was explored in view of reaction rate. The experimental results showed that the humidity of additional gas has an important effect on corona characteristics and modes and stable streamer corona can be generated through optimizing flow rate and humidity of additional gas. Applied voltage, concentration of toluene, humidity of toluene and resident time are some important factors affecting decomposition efficiency. Under optimizing conditions, the decomposition efficiency of toluene can reach 80%. These results can give a conclusion that the corona radical shower technology is feasible and effective on the removal of toluene in the flue gas. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Corona; Decomposition; Radical; Toluene; Toluene; Free Radicals; Gases; Toluene; Decomposition; Flue Gases; Free Radicals; Humidity Control; Nozzles; Plasma Applications; Volatile Organic Compounds; Voltage Control; Corona Radical Shower Systems; Flow Rate; Pipe Electrodes; Reaction Rates; Toluene; Free Radical; Toluene; Decomposition; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Pollution; Article; Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Electrode; Gas; Volatilization; Air Pollution; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Free Radicals; Gases; Volatilization","Decomposition; Flue gases; Free radicals; Humidity control; Nozzles; Plasma applications; Volatile organic compounds; Voltage control; Corona radical shower systems; Flow rate; Pipe electrodes; Reaction rates; Toluene; free radical; toluene; decomposition; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; chemistry; electrochemistry; electrode; gas; volatilization; Air Pollution; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Free Radicals; Gases; Volatilization","","toluene, 108-88-3; Free Radicals, 0; Gases, 0; Toluene, 108-88-3","","Bromberg, Leslie A., Decomposition of dilute concentrations of carbon tetrachloride in air by an electron-beam generated plasma, Physics Letters, Section A: General, Atomic and Solid State Physics, 173, 3, pp. 293-299, (1993); J Aerosol Sci, (1989); Chang, Moo Been, Destniction of Formaldehyde with Dielectric Berrier Discharge Plasmas, Environmental Science and Technology, 29, 1, pp. 181-186, (1995); J Adv Oxid Technol, (1997); Dors, Mirosław, Removal of NOx by DC and pulsed corona discharges in a wet electrostatic precipitator model, Journal of Electrostatics, 45, 1, pp. 25-36, (1998); Proc of Asia Pacific Workshop on Aot 1998, (1998); Hsiao, Mark C., Plasma-assisted decomposition of methanol and trichloroethylene in atmospheric pressure air streams by electrical discharge processing, Journal of Applied Physics, 78, 5, pp. 3451-3456, (1995); Kohno, Hitoshi, 05.O.04 Generation of aerosol particles by spark discharges in a capillary tube under air flow with trace volatile organic compounds, Journal of Aerosol Science, 25, SUPPL. 1, pp. 41-42, (1994); Kohno, Hitoshi, Destruction of volatile organic compounds used in a semiconductor industry by a capillary tube discharge reactor, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 34, 5, pp. 953-966, (1998); Proc Elmeco 94, (1994)","","","","","","","","10010742; 18787320","","","15495952","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3242777673"

Measurements were performed in an external recycle reactor. Reaction rates were measured as a function of temperature and reactants concentrations for two platinum crystallite sizes, 1.0 and 15.5 nm. The turnover frequency (TOF) for the oxidation of both hydrocarbons is about 10 times higher for the 15.5 nm than for the 1.0 nm Pt crystallite size. The reaction constants are calculated according to Mars van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism. The oxygen chemisorption rate constant (k <inf>O</inf> ) is the same during the n-hexane and the toluene oxidation for each sizes of platinum crystallite. For both hydrocarbons the oxygen chemisorption rate constant and the surface reaction rate constant (k <inf>i</inf> ) are higher for 15.5 nm than for 1.0 nm crystallite size. The activation energy for k <inf>O</inf> decreases with the increase of the Pt crystallite size.

The mutual inhibition of the oxidation activity of n-hexane and toluene in the mixtures was observed for both Pt crystallite sizes. The structure sensitivity previously established for the oxidation of single components remains valid for their mixture. The mixture model oxidation based on a Mars van Krevelen mechanism fits very well experimental data at lower temperatures (for n-hexane: 148-160°C; for toluene: 120-140°C), whereas at higher temperatures the model predicts higher values for catalysts with both Pt crystallite sizes. The mixture model based on equilibrium adsorption of hydrocarbons and strong adsorption of oxygen fits exceptionally well experimental data in the whole investigated temperature range. For catalysts with a mean Pt crystallite size of 1.0 nm the evaluated ratio of adsorption coefficients of n-hexane and toluene is 9, and for the catalysts with a mean Pt crystallite size of 15.5 nm the ratio is 0.13. The evaluated ratios of adsorption coefficients point out that n-hexane is more strongly bound than toluene for catalysts with smaller Pt crystallites, while at larger Pt crystallites toluene is more strongly adsorbed than n-hexane. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The goal for this work is to produce a simple, cost-effective technology for reducing the concentration of organic contaminants in air to acceptable levels before the air is released into the atmosphere or recirculated. Specific applications include ventilated work spaces for spray painting and engine maintenance, indoor air decontamination, dry cleaning, food processing, fume hoods, residential use, and solvent-intensive industrial processes. Catalyst powders and monolith-supported catalysts were screened for conversion of 1-butanol, toluene, and methyl ethyl ketone to carbon dioxide and water. The concentration of OVs in the feedstream was maintained at approximately 100 ppmv, and the space velocity was between 6,000 and 18,000 h-1. Metal oxide catalysts without Pt generated complete conversion of 1-butanol to CO<inf>2</inf> at 150°C, 69% conversion at 100°C, and 15% conversion at 80°C. For toluene, complete conversion was achieved at 200°C, and greater than 75% conversion at 150°C. Addition of Pt to the metal oxide compositions typically lowered the temperature for a given OV oxidation rate by at least 20-50°C. Catalysts deposited onto standard commercial cordierite monoliths retained their composition and activity, and were stable in humid air, as well as nitrogen- and chlorine-containing OVs. However, the catalysts quickly, deactivated in the presence of sulfur and phosphorus. © ASCE / MARCH 2004 / 329. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abatement And Removal; Oxidation; Temperature Effects; Vapor; Volatile Organic Chemicals; Catalysis; Catalysts; Decontamination; Impurities; Ketones; Organic Solvents; Oxidation; Platinum; Volatile Organic Compounds; Organic Contaminants; Organic Vapors (ov); Environmental Engineering; Catalyst; Emission Control; Metal Oxide; Oxidation; Platinum; Vapor; Volatile Organic Compound","Catalysis; Catalysts; Decontamination; Impurities; Ketones; Organic solvents; Oxidation; Platinum; Volatile organic compounds; Organic contaminants; Organic vapors (OV); Environmental engineering; catalyst; emission control; metal oxide; oxidation; platinum; vapor; volatile organic compound","","","","Odor and Voc Control Handbook, (1998); Barresi, Antonello A., Deep Catalytic Oxidation of Aromatic Hydrocarbon Mixtures: Reciprocal Inhibition Effects and Kinetics, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 33, 12, pp. 2964-2974, (1994); Batiot-Dupeyrat, C., The role of reactant and product bond energies in determining limitations to selective catalytic oxidations, Applied Catalysis A: General, 137, 1, pp. 179-191, (1996); Bernal-Márquez, Serafín, Some recent results on metal/support interaction effects in NM/CeO2 (NM: noble metal) catalysts, Catalysis Today, 50, 2, pp. 175-206, (1999); de Leitenburg, Carla, Wet oxidation of acetic acid catalyzed by doped ceria, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, 11, 1, pp. L29-L35, (1996); Gangwal, Santosh K., Kinetics and Selectivity of Deep Catalytic Oxidation of n-Hexane and Benzene, Applied Catalysis, 36, C, pp. 231-247, (1988); González, Richard D., Oxidation of ethanol on silica supported noble metal and bimetallic catalysts, Applied Catalysis, 18, 1, pp. 57-70, (1985); Haruta, Masatake, Size- and support-dependency in the catalysis of gold, Catalysis Today, 36, 1, pp. 153-166, (1997); Chem Lett, (1987); Haruta, Masatake, Low-temperature oxidation of CO over gold supported on TiO2, α-Fe2O3, and Co3O4, Journal of Catalysis, 144, 1, pp. 175-192, (1993)","","","","","","","","07339372; 19437870","","JOEED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1642570247"

A DBD-type plasma was generated through a platinum-based catalyst supported on an alumina wash-coated honeycomb monolith by means of a high voltage bi-polar pulsed excitation. The 2-heptanone elimination efficiency increases with the energy density. More than 97% of 2-heptanone conversion is observed, in dry air condition for an energy density of 200J/L. An important synergy effect has been observed between cold plasma and catalyst, the 2-heptanone conversion remaining less than 50% on an uncoated monolith, even at an energy density value higher than 500J/L.

RTO is designed to burn VOCs at high temperature of 800°C to 1, 000°C while minimizing operation costs. To save fuel, RTO uses the regenerative principle in which equipped ceramic media (honeycomb type) are alternately heated and cooled. Up to 99% of the polluting VOCs are converted to harmless substance such as water and carbon dioxide by thermal oxidization, while up to 98% of the waste energy is recovered and reused for the pre-heating process. This RTO system has come into wide use in Europe and America since 1980's to effective control VOCs, and recently has taken notice of the person in concern in Japan.

The organic solvent used to trap benzene was n-hexadecane, and degradation of benzene was achieved in the aqueous phase using the bacterium Alcaligenes xylosoxidans Y234. A gas stream with a benzene concentration of 340 mg l-1 at a flow rate of 0.414 l h-1 was delivered to the system at a loading capacity of 140 g m-3 h-1, and an elimination capacity of 133 g m-3 h-1 was achieved (the volume in this term is the total liquid volume of the TPPB). This elimination capacity is between 3 and 13 times greater than any benzene elimination achieved by biofiltration, a competing biological air treatment strategy. It was also determined that the evaluation of TPPB performance in terms of elimination capacity should include the cell mass present in the system, as this is a readily controllable quantity. A specific benzene utilization rate of 0.57 g benzene (g cells)-1 h-1 was experimentally determined in a bioreactor with a cell concentration that varied dynamically between 0.2 and 1 g l-1. If it assumed that this specific benzene utilization rate (0.57 g g-1 h-1) is independent of cell concentration, then a TPPB operated at high cell concentrations could potentially achieve elimination capacities several hundred times greater than those obtained with biofilters. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Benzene; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Alkanes; Benzene; N-hexadecane; Solvents; Benzene; Biofilter; Bioreactor; Gas-solid Separation; Achromobacter Xylosoxidans; Air Pollution; Article; Bacterial Growth; Flow Rate; Gas; Nonhuman; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Alcaligenes; Alkanes; Benzene; Bioreactors; Filtration; Kinetics; Solvents; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria","benzene; biofilter; bioreactor; gas-solid separation; Achromobacter xylosoxidans; air pollution; article; bacterial growth; flow rate; gas; nonhuman; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Alcaligenes; Alkanes; Benzene; Bioreactors; Filtration; Kinetics; Solvents; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria","","benzene, 71-43-2; Air Pollutants, Occupational, 0; Alkanes, 0; Benzene, 71-43-2; n-hexadecane, 544-76-3; Solvents, 0","Acknowledgement The authors are grateful to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for financial support of this work.","Abumaizar, Riyad J., Analytical model of dual-media biofilter for removal of organic air pollutants, Journal of Environmental Engineering (United States), 123, 6, pp. 606-614, (1997); Collins, Lisa D., Use of a two phase partitioning bioreactor for the biodegradation of phenol, Biotechnology Techniques, 10, 9, pp. 643-648, (1996); Collins, Lisa D., Biodegradation of phenol at high initial concentrations in two-phase partitioning batch and fed-batch bioreactors, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 55, 1, pp. 155-162, (1997); Collins, Lisa D., Characterization and optimization of a two-phase partitioning bioreactor for the biodegradation of phenol, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 48, 1, pp. 18-22, (1997); Collins, Lisa D., Benzene/toluene/p-xylene degradation.

Growing environmental awareness has put up stringent regulations to control the VOCs emissions. In such circumstances, it becomes mandatory for each VOCs emitting industry or facility to opt for proper VOCs control measures. There are many techniques available to control VOCs emission (destruction based and recovery based) with many advantages and limitations. The paper is a review on pollution control techniques of gaseous streams containing volatile organic compounds (VOC), focused on active control: end-of-pipe add-on abatement equipment, control technologies (overview of operation, applicability, advantages and challenges/disadvantages, some key design parameters). Selection criteria as: desired control efficiency (costs, future permitting strategy/flexibility, emission reduction); contaminant properties; stream properties (concentration, flow rate, corrosivity/materials of construction/cost, heat content, vapor pressure, temperature); safety issues (flammability, explosivity); availability of existing pollution controls; collateral waste disposal issues; value of recovered material, were discussed. Deciding on a particular technique becomes a difficult task, so that the paper intend to offer an analysis in order to facilitate the choice on the appropriate strategy to control VOCs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Absorption; Adsorption; Biofiltration; Gaseous Streams; Oxidation; Volatile Organic Compound (voc)","","","","","Absorption Desorption and Fluidized Bed, (1998); Addresses Voc Emissions Problems for New York Circuit Board Manufacturer, (2000); Chemical Engineering Progress, (2001); Evaluating Best Available Control Technology Bact in Air Permit Applications, (2001); Special Feature Biotechnology Voc and Odour Treatment Biotechnology Continues to Move Forward, (2000); Voc Treatment Dont Change an Environmental Problem into A Safety Problem, (2001); Thermal Incineration in Web Offset, (2001); Forest Products Laboratory, (1998); Choosing Voc Control Equipment Huntington Environmental System Products Finishing, (1999); Deshusses, Marc A., Construction and economics of a pilot/full-scale biological trickling filter reactor for the removal of volatile organic compounds from polluted air, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 50, 11, pp. 1947-1956, (2000)","","Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania ccti@tuiasi.ro","","","","","","15829596","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040936376"

The catalysts were characterized by various techniques, including XRD, N<inf>2</inf>-BET, O<inf>2</inf>-TPD and CH<inf>4</inf>-TPR. Among the additives investigated, ZrO<inf>2</inf> was found to be a good promoter for the catalytic activity and stability of the palladium catalysts. The temperatures for methane ignition (T<inf>10%</inf>) and total conversion (T<inf>100%</inf>) of Pd-Zr/HZSM-5 were found to be 25 and 55°C lower than those of Pd/HZSM-5, respectively. Besides, the O<inf>2</inf>-TPD and CH<inf>4</inf>-TPR results indicated that the temperatures for O<inf>2</inf> desorption and reduction by methane of the catalysts decreased with increasing catalytic activities. Therefore, the presence of more reactive PdO<inf>x</inf> (x > 0) species on Pd-Zr/HZSM-5 is suggested as the main reason for its remarkably promoted activity. Although deactivation did occur slightly in the presence of water vapor (4vol.%), the Pd-Zr/HZSM-5 catalyst is thought to be promising for practical applications due to its superior activity for methane total conversion and excellent thermal stability. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Survival data is fitted to a two-stage curve with a shoulder based on the multihit target model. Ozone was removed from the exhaust air to nondetectable levels using a metal oxide based catalyst. The possibility of using ozone as an airborne disinfectant for internal building surfaces and catalytically removing the ozone on exhaust is demonstrated to be feasible. A model for the decay of Bacillus cereus under ozone exposure is proposed as an example for predicting the sterilization of buildings contaminated with anthrax.

The performance of the resulting zeolites on acetone removal when working together with an ionizer was evaluated. It was found that the cobalt containing zeolites worked better than the original NaX in our experiments. Catalytic oxidation mechanism of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside the pores of zeolite was proposed. It is believed that the octahedral coordinated cobalt (II) complexes shift to tetrahedral coordination upon entering into the pores of NaX, which then work with the reactive oxygen species released from the ionizer and catalyze the oxidation reactions of the adsorbed VOCs.

This has caused concern regarding health effects of moldy indoor environments and has resulted in many studies of moisture- and mold-damaged buildings. Recently, there have been reports of severe illness as a result of indoor mold exposure, particularly due to Stachybotrys chartarum. While many authors describe a direct relationship between fungal contamination and illness, close examination of the literature reveals a confusing picture. Here, we review the evidence regarding indoor mold exposure and mycotoxicosis, with an emphasis on S. chartarum. We also examine possible end-organ effects, including pulmonary, immunologic, neurologic, and oncologic disorders. We discuss the Cleveland infant idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage reports in detail, since they provided important impetus for concerns about Stachybotrys. Some valid concerns exist regarding the relationship between indoor mold exposure and human disease. Review of the literature reveals certain fungus-disease associations in humans, including ergotism (Claviceps species), alimentary toxic aleukia (Fusarium), and liver disease (Aspergillys). While many papers suggest a similar relationship between Stachybotrys and human disease, the studies nearly uniformly suffer from significant methodological flaws, making their findings inconclusive. As a result, we have not found well-substantiated supportive evidence of serious illness due to Stachybotrys exposure in the contemporary environment. To address issues of indoor mold-related illness, there is an urgent need for studies using objective markers of illness, relevant animal models, proper epidemiologic techniques, and examination of confounding factors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Aflatoxin; Mycotoxins; Aflatoxin; Mycotoxin; Trichothecene Derivative; Allergic Pneumonitis; Asthma; Disease Association; Endocrine Disease; Hematologic Disease; Immunopathology; Infection; Kidney Disease; Liver Disease; Lung Disease; Lung Hemorrhage; Lung Injury; Neurologic Disease; Pregnancy; Review; Stachybotrys Chartarum; Air Microbiology; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mycoses; Mycotoxins; Stachybotrys; Animalia; Aspergillus; Claviceps; Fungi; Fusarium","aflatoxin; mycotoxin; trichothecene derivative; allergic pneumonitis; asthma; disease association; endocrine disease; hematologic disease; immunopathology; infection; kidney disease; liver disease; lung disease; lung hemorrhage; lung injury; neurologic disease; pregnancy; review; Stachybotrys chartarum; Air Microbiology; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mycoses; Mycotoxins; Stachybotrys; Animalia; Aspergillus; Claviceps; Fungi; Fusarium","","aflatoxin, 1402-68-2; Mycotoxins, 0","","Abdel-Hafez, Sobhy Ibrahim Ismail, Mycoflora and trichothecene toxins of paddy grains from Egypt, Mycopathologia, 100, 2, pp. 103-112, (1987); Acierno, Louis J., Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to forced air systems - A review of selected literature and a commentary on recognition and prevention, Journal of Environmental Health, 48, 3, pp. 138-141, (1985); undefined, (2004); Principles of Neurology, (1985); Ahearn, Donald G., Fungal colonization of fiberglass insulation in the air distribution system of a multi-story office building: VOC production and possible relationship to a sick building syndrome, Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, 16, 5, pp. 280-285, (1996); Åhman, Mats, Improved health after intervention in a school with moisture problems, Indoor Air, 10, 1, pp. 57-62, (2000); Akkmeteli, M.

The results show that the TCE conversion starts from 5% at 443 K and rises to very high values in the 673-873 K ranges and that the CO<inf>2</inf> yield also pushes to 99% at the same temperature ranges.

A., ; Girard, Ivan D., ","The sources of industrial odors are numerous and vary a lot. Odor treatment is possible by treating the source of the odor with adapted methods to the odor nature (liquid, solid or gaseous). The NORA SYSTEM® (destructive effect system - DES) consists of a 3-step program; a diagnosis on site, an identification of odor sources and the adaptation of a treatment type for the specific polluting source. The diagnosis uses sensorial methods based on the best detector, the nose but also using analytical methods (gas chromatography) in order to caracterize and to quantify molecules responsible for the odors. Classical methods (gas washing, biological filters) can decrease partially the concentrations of polutants (toxic or simply olfactory). However, traces of pollutants (ppm or ppb) can escape through the process and end up in the air as polluting odors for the workers or the neighbours. The DES proposes simple solutions that act directly on polluting molecules by destruction and not by masking. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Effluent Treatment; Gas Chromatography; Odor Removal; Volatile Organic Compounds; Destructive Effect Systems (des); Paper And Pulp Mills; Air Pollution; Effluent Treatment; Gas Chromatography; Odor Control; Paper Mills; Voc","Air pollution; Effluent treatment; Gas chromatography; Odor removal; Volatile organic compounds; Destructive effect systems (DES); Paper and pulp mills; Air Pollution; Effluent Treatment; Gas Chromatography; Odor Control; Paper Mills; Voc","","","","undefined, (2004); undefined, (2004); undefined, (2004); Graedel, Thomas E., The perceived intensity of natural odors, Journal of Chemical Education, 61, 8, pp. 681-686, (1984); Amoore, John E., THE STEROCHEMICAL THEORY OF ODOR., Scientific American, 210, pp. 42-49, (1964); Conference Olfaction Et Agroalimentaire, (2001)","","","TAPPI; NCASI; PAPTAC; FSDA","Proceedings of the 2002 TAPPI International Environmental Conference and Exhibit","","Montreal, QC","61664","","","IECOF","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0142249816"

Column tests were made to examine the performances of continuous adsorption operations under conditions of different inlet MTBE concentrations, feed flow rates, and temperatures. A theoretical model based on the general logistic function was adopted and tested for describing the MTBE breakthrough behaviors of the adsorption resin column. The identified breakthrough model significantly facilitates practical design of the MTBE adsorption system.

This preparation method led to a significant decrease of the specific surface area and specific pore volume of the supports. The presence of metallic Pt crystallites having average diameters in the 70-100 Å range has been detected by X-ray diffraction in the samples reduced in hydrogen at 500°C. This suggests that platinum is poorly dispersed on the catalysts surface. The catalysts have been used for the complete acetone oxidation as an example of the control by means of catalytic combustion of the volatile organic compound (VOC's) emissions.

When adsorbed together, cyclohexene and thiophene have similar breakthrough times with little tendency for one to displace the other. However the adsorption of thiophene continues beyond that of diethylamine in mixtures while thiophene is itself displaced by methylmethacrylate. Oxidation of the binary mixtures is controlled by that of thiophene which requires temperatures somewhat above 300°C for complete removal. Combustion of the other VOCs proceeds in parallel with thiophene although they react at much lower temperatures when alone. Both components of the mixtures can be removed by a system in which the VOCs are accumulated on carbon and then undergo temperature programmed desorption in air onto Pd/CeO<inf>2</inf>/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> held at 350°C.

R., Instituto de Investigaciones en Catálisis y Petroquímica, Santa Fe, Argentina","The structure sensitivity and in situ activation of benzene combustion on Pt/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts of different platinum and chlorine loadings were studied. The catalyst activities were evaluated through both conversion versus temperature (light-off curves) and conversion versus time catalytic tests. The light-off curves shifted to lower temperature with increasing Pt particle size, thereby suggesting that benzene combustion is a structure sensitive reaction. Kinetically-controlled catalytic tests confirmed that benzene oxidation turnover rates are preferentially promoted by larger Pt crystallites. Kinetic studies showed that the reaction orders and the apparent activation energy are not changed by changing the metallic dispersion. Results are explained by considering that benzene oxidation proceeds via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism which involves the rapid and strong adsorption of benzene on metallic platinum and assumes that the rate constant of oxygen adsorption is very low compared to the rate constant of the surface reaction. The number of Pt-O bonds of lower binding energy, i.e. the site density of more reactive surface oxygen, increases on larger Pt particles. Low-conversion catalytic tests performed at constant temperature showed that on well,dispersed Pt/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts the benzene conversion increases with time, irrespective of the chlorine content on the sample. TEM examination and hydrogen chemisorption measurements suggested that the activity increase parallels a concomitant increase in the platinum particle size. In contrast, sintered samples (platinum dispersions lower than 10%) did not exhibit initial activation periods. It is proposed that the initial in situ activation of well-dispersed Pt catalysts is caused by the sintering of the metallic phase. Hot-spots on the metallic particles together with the presence of gaseous water cause the formation of larger Pt crystallites, even at mild reaction conditions. As a result, the benzene conversion increases with time until the formation of larger steady state Pt particles is completed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benzene Combustion; Platinum Catalysts; Structure-sensitive Reactions; Activation Analysis; Binding Energy; Catalyst Activity; Chemisorption; Crystalline Materials; Platinum; Reaction Kinetics; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Steady States; Benzene","Activation analysis; Binding energy; Catalyst activity; Chemisorption; Crystalline materials; Platinum; Reaction kinetics; Transmission electron microscopy; Steady states; Benzene","","","We acknowledge P.

We have explored the use of a high pressure glow discharge in a near atmospheric and atmospheric pressure benzene/air mixture for benzene remediation. By using a micro-hollow cathode discharge (MHCD) as an electron source to lower or eliminate the cathode fall voltage, a glow discharge could be operated either in a dc mode [1] or in a pulse-superimposed mode [2] at atmospheric pressure air. A higher than 90% destruction rate has been obtained by flowing a benzene/dry air mixture through the dc glow discharge. For a pressure of 720 torr, superimposed electric pulses caused an increase in destruction of benzene, however, for 760 torr, the remediation effect was reversed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Pressure; Cathodes; Electron Sources; Glow Discharges; Mixtures; Volatile Organic Compounds; Atmospheric Pressure Air; Atmospheric Pressure Air Glow Discharges; Cathode Fall Voltage; Dc Glow Discharge; Destruction Rates; Direct Current; High Pressure Glow Discharges; Microhollow Cathode Discharges; Benzene","Atmospheric pressure; Cathodes; Electron sources; Glow discharges; Mixtures; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric pressure air; Atmospheric pressure air glow discharges; Cathode fall voltage; DC glow discharge; Destruction rates; Direct current; High pressure glow discharges; Microhollow cathode discharges; Benzene","","","","Stark, Robert H., Direct current glow discharges in atmospheric air, Applied Physics Letters, 74, 25, pp. 3770-3772, (1999); Stark, Robert H., Electron heating in atmospheric pressure glow discharges, Journal of Applied Physics, 89, 7, pp. 3568-3572, (2001); J Adv Oxid Technol, (1997); Odor and Voc Control Handbook, (1998); Urashima, Kuniko, Removal of volatile organic compounds from air streams and industrial flue gases by non-thermal plasma technology, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 7, 5, pp. 602-614, (2000); McCorkle, Dennis L., Dissociation of benzene and methylene chloride based on enhanced dissociative electron attachment to highly excited molecules, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 32, 1, pp. 46-54, (1999); McCorkle, Dennis L., Dissociation of benzene in a pulsed glow discharge, Journal of Applied Physics, 86, 7, pp. 3550-3557, (1999); Leipold, Frank, Electron density measurements in an atmospheric pressure air plasma by means of infrared heterodyne interferometry, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, 33, 18, pp. 2268-2273, (2000); Rennie, Emma E., A photoabsorption, photodissociation and photoelectron spectroscopy study of C6H6 and C6D6, Chemical Physics, 229, 1, pp. 107-123, (1998); Abouelaziz, H., Measurements of C3H3+, C5H 3+, C6H6+, C 7H5+, and C10H8 + dissociative recombination rate coefficients, Journal of Chemical Physics, 99, 1, pp. 237-243, (1993)","Reinovsky, R.; Newton, M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","The Plasma Science and Applications Committee; The Pulsed Power Science and Technology Committee of the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","28th IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science and 13th IEEE International Pulsed Power Conference, PPPS 2001","","Las Vegas; NV; Rio Hotel","116562","","9780780371200; 0780371208","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951945785"

Whatever the catalyst, o-xylene oxidation into CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O is accompanied by the retention within the zeolite pores of heavy compounds ('coke'). The relative significance of these reactions depends on the operating conditions (temperature, time-on-stream) and on the catalyst characteristics (Pd or Pt, Si/Al ratio). Over Pt and Pd/HFAU(17), time-on-stream has a positive effect on the xylene oxidation apparently related to the reducibility of Pd and Pt species during the reaction. The higher activity of Pt/HFAU catalysts can be attributed to its greater number of active species (especially Pt0). Those active species can be more rapidly formed than Pd0 by auto reduction during the calcination of Pt precursor. Whatever the metal, the higher the Si/Al ratio of the support, the faster the xylene oxidation and the lower the coke formation. This can be related to the higher proportion of reduced species (Pd0 and Pt0) formed on the more dealuminated catalyst but also to the hydrophobicity of the support. Indeed, the hydrophobicity of the zeolite play a positive role in the oxidation activity in presence of steam; the higher the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, the faster the o-xylene oxidation. Thus a catalyst with a low platinum content supported on a hydrophobic zeolite (0.10Pt/HFAU(100)) allows to oxidising totally o-xylene at 210°C in presence of steam. © 2001 Académie des sciences / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS. © 2005 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

The air treatment processes of countercurrent wet oxidation scrubbing and granulated activated carbon adsorption are available for emissions control at Deer Island. In addition, since the wastewater treatment process of biochemical oxidation is fully enclosed at the site, microbial destruction of VOCs is an intrinsic treatment process for organic gases. Surveyed results of wastewater research literature indicate that the use of scrubbers for the removal of VOCs is controversial, as the fate of volatile hydrocarbon molecules across odor control scrubbers is complex and not fully understood. Continuous emission monitoring tests across the Deer Island scrubbers have consistently shown a VOC removal efficiency in excess of 50%. The fate of the scrubber inlet VOCs at Deer Island was researched as part of a plant-wide, on-going VOC study. Removal efficiencies across the pure oxygen bioreactors were also investigated. Preliminary results of this study indicate chemical reactions involving VOCs in odor control scrubbers partially oxidize and chlorinate derivatives possibly destroying a fraction of the compounds by complete oxidation. In addition, VOC reduction across the enclosed aerobic bioreactors was found to be significant.

The catalyst activities were evaluated through both conversion vs. temperature (light-off curves) and conversion vs. time catalytic tests. Cyclopentane oxidation turnover rates (TOF) increased dramatically with increasing Pt crystallite size while TOF values for methane oxidation increased only three times by diminishing the Pt dispersion from 65 to 15%. The reaction orders in oxygen were one (cyclopentane) and zero (CH<inf>4</inf>). For both reactions, the orders and activation energies did not change by changing the Pt dispersion. Results are interpreted in basis of two different reaction mechanisms over the metallic Pt active sites. Cyclopentane oxidation proceeds via a surface redox mechanism, being the dissociative adsorption of oxygen the rate-determining step. The observed turnover rate increase with increasing Pt particle size reflects an increase in the density of reactive Pt-O species resulting from higher Pt oxidation rates. The methane oxidation mechanism is interpreted in terms of Mars-van Kravelen reduction-oxidation pathways which include the abstraction of the first hydrogen on the adsorbed methane molecule as the rate-determining step. Low-conversion catalytic tests performed at constant temperature showed that on well-dispersed Pt/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts the cyclopentane conversion increases with time on stream, while the methane activity decreases. Activating induction periods during the oxidation of cyclopentane are related to the sintering of the metallic phase in reaction conditions. Hot-spots on the metallic particles together with the presence of gaseous water cause the formation of larger, more reactive, Pt crystallites, even at mild reaction conditions. The activation phenomenon ab initio of the reaction is not verified for methane oxidation on Pt/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts. The different structure sensitivity of the slowest steps in the reaction-oxidation mechanisms explains the existence of induction periods on well-dispersed Pt catalysts only for cyclopentane oxidation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activation Energy; Alumina; Catalysis; Catalyst Activity; Chlorine; Combustion; Dispersions; Dissociation; Gas Adsorption; Oxidation; Platinum; Reaction Kinetics; Cyclopentane; Methane","Activation energy; Alumina; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Chlorine; Combustion; Dispersions; Dissociation; Gas adsorption; Oxidation; Platinum; Reaction kinetics; Cyclopentane; Methane","","","We acknowledge E.

The pre-catalytic effects (electric discharge plus the action of ozone), the conventional and IOCC combustion tests were studied. Two different catalysts were used: oxide catalyst, copper-chromite (Cu-Cr), and Pt metal catalyst (0.5 wt.% Pt/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>). The abatement of ACN was markedly influenced by the pre-catalytic effects. Starting from 3 kV, an increasing abatement of ACN was observed with the voltage applied to the ionization reactor at any initial ACN concentration (500-1500 ppm). The ACN catalytic combustion, performed by the IOCC technique, led to 91 and 98% yield of CO<inf>2</inf> on Cu-Cr and Pt catalysts, respectively, at 260°C. Complete absence of hazardous intermediates, such as hydrogen cyanide, was observed. The Cu-Cr catalyst, at 300°C, was able to abate 57 and 23% of VCM at 10 000 and 20 000 h-1, respectively. IOCC combustion led to improved conversion. At 200°C and 3300 h-1, 98% and only 49% of VCM abatement operating according to IOCC and classical combustion was obtained, respectively. The IOCC combustion runs, performed at different initial VCM concentrations (585 and 1170 ppm), indicated a superior abatement when low VCM concentration was fed, at a given catalyst temperature and contact time. This indicated a marked influence of the pre-catalytic effects on the abatement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catalysts; Combustion; Cyanides; Electric Discharges; Ionization; Oxides; Ozonization; Platinum; Toxic Materials; Volatile Organic Compounds; Acrylonitrile; Catalytic Effects; Copper Chromite; Ionization Ozonization Catalytic Combustion Technique; Vinyl Chloride; Catalysis","Catalysts; Combustion; Cyanides; Electric discharges; Ionization; Oxides; Ozonization; Platinum; Toxic materials; Volatile organic compounds; Acrylonitrile; Catalytic effects; Copper chromite; Ionization ozonization catalytic combustion technique; Vinyl chloride; Catalysis","","","This work was assisted by CNR grant (Progetto Strategico — Gruppo Nazionale per la Difesa dai Rischi Chimico Industriali ed Ecologici).

The supported catalyst was prepared using a sol-gel method and irradiated employing two different light sources, a medium pressure mercury lamp or a xenon-chloride excimer lamp. The experimental set-up was especially designed for generating a gas stream containing stable and defined concentrations of the model pollutants. The gas stream at the reactor exit was analyzed on line by gas chromatography and the structures of the intermediates were established by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Six major intermediates (butanal, butanoic acid, 1-propanol, propanal, ethanol and ethanal) were identified in the case of the photocatalytic degradation of 1-butanol. 1-Butylamine was less efficiently adsorbed on the catalyst and its degradation was slower.

VOCs are one of the main sources of photochemical reaction in the atmosphere leading to various environmental hazards; on the other hand, these VOCs have good commercial value. Growing environmental awareness has put up stringent regulations to control the VOCs emissions. In such circumstances, it becomes mandatory for each VOCs emitting industry or facility to opt for proper VOCs control measures. There are many techniques available to control VOCs emission (destruction based and recovery based) with many advantages and limitations. Therefore, deciding on a particular technique becomes a difficult task. This article illustrates various available options for VOCs control. It further details the merits, demerits and applicability of each option. The authors hope that this article will help in critically analysing the requirements and accordingly decide on the appropriate strategy to control VOCs. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adsorption; Bio-filtration; Membrane; Oxidation; Rfr; Volatile Organic Compounds (vocs); Adsorption; Environmental Impact; Environmental Protection; Filtration; Hazards; Oxidation; Photochemical Reactions; Volatile Organic Compounds; Biofiltration; Air Pollution Control","Adsorption; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Filtration; Hazards; Oxidation; Photochemical reactions; Volatile organic compounds; Biofiltration; Air pollution control","","","","Current and Potential Future Industrial Practices for Reducing and Controlling Volatile Organic Compounds, (1992); Baker, Richard W., Separation of organic vapors from air, Journal of Membrane Science, 31, 2-3, pp. 259-271, (1987); Proceedings of the 6th Annual Membrane Technology Planning Conference Session V 4 Cambridge, (1986); Behling, Rolf Dieter, Separation of hydrocarbons from waste vapor streams, AIChE Symposium Series, 85, 272, pp. 68-73, (1989); Blocki, Stephen W., Hydrophobic zeolite adsorbent: A proven advancement in solvent separation technology, Environmental Progress, 12, 3, pp. 226-230, (1993); Kinetic Catalysis, (1982); Bobrova, Ludmilla N., Unsteady-state performance of NOx catalytic reduction by NH3, Reaction Kinetics and Catalysis Letters, 37, 2, pp. 267-272, (1988); Unsteady State Processes in Catalysis, (1990); Proceedings of the International Conference on Membrane and Membrane Processes Chicago, (1990); Chadha, Nick, Minimize emissions of air toxics via process changes, Chemical Engineering Progress, 89, 1, pp. 37-42, (1993)","","Elsevier BV","","","","","","09504230","","JLPIE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033704526"

Both thermal plasmas and non-equilibrium plasmas (cold plasmas) are being developed for VOCs cleanup[2,3]. Particularly, pulsed corona discharges offer several advantages over conventional VOCs abatement techniques[4-7]. To optimize the existing technology and to develop it further, there is need to understand the mechanisms involved in plasma chemical reactions. Furthermore, it is strongly desirable to be able to predict the behavior of new VOCs in non-equilibrium plasma environment from the data known for a few representative compounds. Pulsed corona discharge technique is introduced here with citation of relevant literature. Fundamental principles, useful for predicting the VOCs' decomposition behavior, have been worked out from the published literature. Latest developments in the area, targeted to minimize the energy losses, improve the VOCs destruction efficiency and reduce the generation of unwanted organic and inorganic by-products, are presented. © 2006 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Purification; Corona Discharges; Non-equilibrium Plasma; Volatile Organic Compounds; Water Purification; Air Purification; Electric Corona; Energy Dissipation; Volatile Organic Compounds; Pulsed Corona Discharges; Plasma Applications","Air purification; Electric corona; Energy dissipation; Volatile organic compounds; Pulsed corona discharges; Plasma applications","","","","Chem Eng Prog, (1995); Cohn, Daniel R., Environmental cleanup applications of hot and cold plasmas, Journal of Fusion Energy, 12, 4, pp. 375-378, (1993); Huczko, Andrzej, Plasma chemistry and environmental protection: Application of thermal and non-thermal plasmas, Czechoslovak Journal of Physics, 45, 12, pp. 1023-1033, (1995); Masuda, Sen'ichi, Pulse corona induced plasma chemical process: A horizon of new plasma chemical technologies, Pure and Applied Chemistry, 60, 5, pp. 727-731, (1988); Ramanathan, Kumar, Control of Volatile Organic Compounds by an ac Energized Ferroelectric Pellet Reactor and a Pulsed Corona Reactor, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 28, 3, pp. 528-534, (1992); Proceedings of the 2nd Int Conf Appl Electrostatics, (1993); Masuda, Sen'ichi, Novel plasma chemical technologies - PPCP and SPCP for control of gaseous pollutants and air toxics, Journal of Electrostatics, 34, 4, pp. 415-438, (1995); Top Curr Chem, (1980); Marston, George M., The excited state in atmospheric chemistry, Chemical Society Reviews, 25, 1, pp. 33-40, (1996); Colin Baird, N., Introducing atmospheric reactions: A systematic approach for students, Journal of Chemical Education, 72, 2, pp. 153-155, (1995)","","","","","","","","10049541","","CJCEE","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033285233"

Alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids, aromatics and alkanes were included in the range. In general, the reactivity pattern observed was alcohols > aromatics > ketones > carboxylic acids > alkanes, although some overlap was observed in that the more reactive alkanes were more readily oxidized than the less reactive carboxylic acids. The same order of reactivity was observed for all the catalysts studied here. A kinetic isotope effect was observed when deuterated acetone was compared to normal acetone, consistent with C-H bond cleavage being the slow step in the catalytic oxidation of this substrate. A correlation was found between the reactivity of the individual substrates and the strength of the weakest C-H bond in the structure. A single weak C-H bond in the substrate led to a high reactivity. It is postulated that catalytic oxidation on platinum catalysts proceeds via initial rupture of the weakest C-H bond in the substrate followed by further reaction steps which involves free radical chemistry. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Nutrient-containing water keeps the surface of the rotating disks wet, absorbing contaminants in the gas stream. A film of active, naturally occurring microorganisms on the disk surface removes absorbed contaminants, converting them to CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O. Water conveys any excess biomass through the vessel for removal in a clarifier. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

Silver containing mixed oxide was highly active when it was calcined at lower temperature (400C) due to the surface exposed metallic Ag°. However, when the catalyst was calcined at higher temperature (800 ""C), it became less active since Ag° was changed into Ag ion to form AgzMnOi. The complete oxidation of various VOCs by this catalyst took place at 2701, which is 80-180^ lower than the literature values. Therefore, mixed metal oxide seems to be substituted for noble metal catalysts for the economic removal of VOCs.

Strain DCA1 utilizes DCA as the sole carbon and energy source and does not require additional organic nutrients, such as vitamins, for optimal growth. The affinity of strain DCA1 for DCA is very high, with a K(m) value below the detection limit of 0.5 μM. Instead of a hydrolytic dehalogenation, as in other DCA utilizers, the first step in DCA degradation in strain DCA1 is an oxidation reaction. Oxygen and NAD(P)H are required for this initial step. Propene was converted to 1,2- epoxypropane by DCA-grown cells and competitively inhibited DCA degradation. We concluded that a monooxygenase is responsible for the first step in DCA degradation in strain DCA1. Oxidation of DCA probably results in the formation of the unstable intermediate 1,2-dichloroethanol, which spontaneously releases chloride, yielding chloroacetaldehyde. The DCA degradation pathway in strain DCA1 proceeds from chloroacetaldehyde via chloroacetic acid and presumably glycolic acid, which is similar to degradation routes observed in other DCA-utilizing bacteria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chloroacetaldehyde; Dichloroethane; Propylene Oxide; Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate; Unspecific Monooxygenase; Chloroacetaldehyde; Dichloroethane; Propylene Oxide; Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate; Unspecific Monooxygenase; Article; Bacterium Identification; Bacterium Isolation; Biofilm; Competitive Inhibition; Enzyme Assay; Enzyme Degradation; Nonhuman; Oxidation Reduction Reaction; Protein Content; Pseudomonas; Temperature Dependence; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Pseudomonas Sp.","chloroacetaldehyde; dichloroethane; propylene oxide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; unspecific monooxygenase; article; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; biofilm; competitive inhibition; enzyme assay; enzyme degradation; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; protein content; Pseudomonas; temperature dependence; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Pseudomonas sp.","","chloroacetaldehyde, 107-20-0; dichloroethane, 1300-21-6; propylene oxide, 75-56-9; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, 53-57-6; unspecific monooxygenase, 9012-80-0, 9037-52-9, 9038-14-6","","Amoore, John E., Odor as an ald to chemical safety: Odor thresholds compared with threshold limit values and volatilities for 214 industrial chemicals in air and water dilution, Journal of Applied Toxicology, 3, 6, pp. 272-290, (1983); Armfield, Susan J., Dehalogenation of haloalkanes by Rhodococcus erythropolis Y2 - The presence of an oxygenase-type dehalogenase activity complements that of an halidohydrolase activity, Biodegradation, 6, 3, pp. 237-246, (1995); Barbash, Jack E., Abiotic Dehalogenation of 1,2-Dichloroethane and 1,2-Dibromoethane in Aqueous Solution Containing Hydrogen Sulfide, Environmental Science and Technology, 23, 11, pp. 1349-1358, (1989); Bergmann, J.

Different amounts of granular activated carbon (GAC) are mixed with the compost in two of the three columns to evaluate the extent to which biofilter performance can be enhanced. The columns displayed preferential utilization of benzene followed by toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene, respectively. Removal efficiencies of ≤ 90% were achieved for inlet concentrations of ≤ 200 ppm of each of the BTEX compounds and a gas loading rate of 17.6 m3/m2 h in all columns over the period of study.

Temperature and concentration profiles have been obtained for oxidation of several VOCs as functions of space time π. Appropriate conditions for 99.99% removal of VOC and 99.5% oxidation of intermediate CO appear to be 930 to 980 K inlet temperature, 0.05 to 0.06 kmol auxiliary fuel per kmol dry waste air and 90 to 130% excess air for auxiliary fuel, without heat recovery.

Various Federal and/or State Regulations require monitoring, and control of these emissions down to some specified levels. At the Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), air containing hydrogen sulfide is collected and treated in several emission control systems. These systems consist of wet scrubbers which facilitate destruction of hydrogen sulfide gas and the related odor by continuously contacting the collected air counter-currently with a strong oxidizing solution of sodium hypochlorite. This paper reviews the performance of a typical scrubber in light of the theory of absorption followed by chemical reaction. Based on an analysis of a set of test data, it has been concluded that when the concentration of hydrogen sulfide at a scrubber inlet exceeds 25 ppm, the scrubber becomes mass transfer limited. This can lead to the incomplete oxidation of hydrogen sulfide gas. Unreacted H<inf>2</inf>S eventually can exit the scrubber while partially oxidized H<inf>2</inf>S, in the form of elemental sulfur, can deposit on, and eventually foul, the packing media. Measures taken to overcome such a situation have also been reported. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gas Absorption; Gas Emissions; Hydrogen Sulfide; Laws And Legislation; Mass Transfer; Oxidation; Scrubbers; Sewage Treatment Plants; Sodium Compounds; Trace Elements; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wastewater Treatment; Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants; Packed Scrubbers; Sodium Hypochlorite; Air Pollution Control Equipment","Gas absorption; Gas emissions; Hydrogen sulfide; Laws and legislation; Mass transfer; Oxidation; Scrubbers; Sewage treatment plants; Sodium compounds; Trace elements; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater treatment; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Packed scrubbers; Sodium hypochlorite; Air pollution control equipment","","","","Wastewater Microbiology, (1994); Thibodeaux, Louis J., Chemodynamics - environmental movement of chemicals in air, water and soil., (1979); Water Chemistry, (1980); Gas Liquid Reactions, (1970); Perry S Chemical Engineers Handbook, (1997); Mass Transfer Operations, (1980)","","American Institute of Chemical Engineers","","","","","","15475921; 02784491; 10982280","","ENVPD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032025109"

The site's location in a river valley, combined with meteorological factors, have resulted in community odor issues. The predominant sources of odor have been traced to pulp mill and sludge dryer exhausts. Several technologies were investigated for odor control including biological treatment, wet oxidative scrubbing, and thermal oxidation. Regenerative Thermal Oxidation (RTO) was selected due to its high VOC destruction efficiency and ability to process high moisture and high temperature feeds. Four issues faced the project team: 1) Would the RTO be capable of eliminating sludge dryer odor? 2) Would the RTO demonstrate satisfactory VOC destruction? 3) How would the RTO's ceramic media react to salts and particulate entrained in the feed streams? 4) What materials of construction would be required? To answer these questions a 3 month pilot study was planned using a 2 chamber, 17,000 liter per minute RTO. The study concluded that RTO is an effective technology for the control of sludge dryer odor and VOC emissions. Sudden and irreversible media build up due to salts and particulate will not be an issue with the technology. Stainless steel was found to be a suitable material of construction. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

Biofiltration units are microbial systems incorporating microorganisms grown on a porous solid media like compost, peat, soil or mixture of these materials. The filter media and the microbial culture are surrounded by a thin film of water called biofilm. Waste-gases containing biodegradable VOCs and inorganic air toxics are vented through this biologically active material, where soluble contaminants partition into the liquid film and are biodegraded by the resident microorganisms in the biofilm. The technology has been successfully applied to a wide range of industrial and public sector sources for the abatement of odors, VOCs and air toxics, with an elimination efficiency of more than 90%. Owing to its economic advantage over the conventional air pollution control methods coupled with environmental benefits like low energy requirements and the avoidance of cross-media transfer of pollutants, biofiltration is becoming more popular and practical in meeting the statutory emission regulations. The study presents an overview of the historical development and present status of biofiltration; summarizes its basic requirements, engineering fundamentals, operating principles, applicability, cost-effectiveness and potential failures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Toxics; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Odors; Vocs; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Air Pollution; Air Pollution Control; Biofilms; Cost Effectiveness; Hazardous Materials; Odors; Volatile Organic Compounds; Biotechnology; Volatile Organic Compound; Air Pollutant; Air Pollution Control; Article; Biofiltration; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Gas Waste; Odor","Biofilters; Biofiltration; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Biofilms; Cost effectiveness; Hazardous materials; Odors; Volatile organic compounds; Biotechnology; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; biofiltration; cost effectiveness analysis; gas waste; odor","","","","Ottengraf, Simon P.P., Biological systems for waste gas elimination, Trends in Biotechnology, 5, 5, pp. 132-136, (1987); Bohn, Hinrich L., Consider biofiltration for decontaminating gases, Chemical Engineering Progress, 88, 4, pp. 34-40, (1992); Environ Eng World, (1995); European Coatings Journal, (1994); Añón, J.

Technical grade xylene contains a mixture of the three isomers and also some ethylbenzene. The estimated world production in 1984 was 15.4 million tonnes. Xylene is a colourless liquid at room temperature with an aromatic odour. The vapour pressure lies between 0.66 and 0.86 kPa for the three isomers. Approximately 92% of mixed xylenes is blended into petrol. It is also used in a variety of solvent applications, particularly in the paint and printing ink industries. The majority of xylene released into the environment enters the atmosphere directly. In the atmosphere the xylene isomers are readily degraded, primarily by photooxidation. Volatilization to the atmosphere from water is rapid for all three isomers. In soil and water, the meta and para isomers are readily biodegraded under a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but the ortho isomer is more persistent. The limited evidence available suggests that bioaccumulation of the xylene isomers by fish and invertebrates is low. Elimination of xylene from aquatic organisms is fairly rapid once exposure has ceased. Typically, mean background levels of all three xylene isomers in ambient air are around 1 μg/m3, but in suburban areas they are around 3 μg/m3. Higher levels have been measured in urban and industrialized areas, mean concentrations ranging up to 500 μg/m3. However, concentrations are generally below 100 μg/m3. Estimated daily exposure of the general population through inhalations is 70 μg in rural areas and less than 2000 μg in urban areas. The concentration in drinking-water ranges from not detectable to 12 μg/litre. The data on the level in food are too limited to estimate daily oral exposure. Mean background concentrations of xylenes in surface water are generally below 0.1 μg/litre. However, much higher values have been measured in industrial areas and areas associated with the oil industry (up to 30 μg/litre in polluted waters and up to 2000 μg/litre near to discharge pipes). Similar background levels have been reported for groundwater although high levels have been reported due to localized pollution from underground storage tanks and pipes. After inhalation exposure the retention in the lungs is about 60% of the inhaled dose. Xylene is efficiently metabolized. More than 90% is biotransformed to methylhippuric acid, which is excreted in mice. Xylene does not accumulate significantly in the human body. Acute exposure to high concentrations of xylene can result in CNS effects and irritation in humans. However, there have been no long-term controlled human studies or epidemiological studies. The chronic toxicity appears to be relatively low in laboratory animals. There is suggestive evidence, however, that chronic CNS effects may occur in animals at moderate concentrations of xylene. Xylene appears not to be a mutagen or a carcinogen. The critical end-point is developmental toxicity, which has been demonstrated at an exposure level of 870 mg/m3 (200 ppm) in rats. Based on this end-point, the recommended guidance value for xylene in air is 0.87 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm). The xylene isomers are of moderate to low toxicity for aquatic organisms. For invertebrates the lowest LC<inf>50</inf> value, based on measured concentrations, is for o-xylene at 1 mg/litre (Daphnia magna). The lowest LC<inf>50</inf> values recorded for fish are 7.6 mg/litre for o-xylene (rainbow trout; based on measured concentrations), and 7.9 and 1.7 mg/litre for m- and p-xylenes respectively (both for striped bass; based on nominal concentrations). Limited information is available regarding chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to xylenes; however, rapid volatilization makes chronic exposure in water unlikely. The acute toxicity or xylene to birds is low. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Xylene; Ground Water; Xylene; Chemical Carcinogenesis; Daphnia; Environmental Exposure; Mutagenesis; Nonhuman; Oil Industry; Review; Water Pollution; Animalia; Aves; Daphnia Magna; Invertebrata; Morone Saxatilis; Oncorhynchus Mykiss; Salmonidae","ground water; xylene; chemical carcinogenesis; Daphnia; environmental exposure; mutagenesis; nonhuman; oil industry; review; water pollution; Animalia; Aves; Daphnia magna; Invertebrata; Morone saxatilis; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae","","xylene, 1330-20-7","","Añón, J.

However, very little information is available on the ability of RTOs to control carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. This paper presents the results of extensive tests conducted on two RTOs to determine their VOC and CO control efficiencies. The inlet gas stream to the RTOs includes VOC and CO concentrations as high as 2,000 ppm and 3,600 ppm, respectfully. The testing demonstrated that both RTOs were capable of controlling greater than 98% of both inlet VOCs and CO. While the destruction efficiencies within the combustion chambers exceeded 99.9%, direct leakage past valves accounted for the lower control efficiencies. The tests indicated that the overall VOC and CO control efficiencies of the RTOs may be limited by valve leakage. The design and permitting of a RTO should include conservative control estimates which account for possible valve leakage. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emission Control; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers; Air Pollution Control; Carbon Monoxide; Efficiency; Odor Control; Oxidation; Particulate Emissions; Testing; Volatile Organic Compounds; Air Pollution Control Equipment","Emission control; Regenerative thermal oxidizers; Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Efficiency; Odor control; Oxidation; Particulate emissions; Testing; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollution control equipment","","","","","Anon","","ASME","Proceedings of the 1996 17th Biennial Waste Processing Conference","","Atlantic City, NJ, USA","46197","","079181209X; 0791806650","PWPCD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030368191"

In 1990, Biothermica developed a unique technology for treating organic emissions that pollute and generate odors. This regenerative incineration system, called BIOTOX, is a thermal oxidation process that offers a destruction efficiency in excess of environmental requirements and uses more than 90% of the heat generated by the combustion of volatile and condensable organic compounds and natural gas. A number of improvements were required to adapt the conventional regenerative incineration process to the treatment of fumes containing condensable heavy organics such as those generated from asphalt coating processes. COC accumulation, which can cause overheating and even fire, has been eliminated by patented features such as a hot purge system combined with a cyclonic separator. In addition, the equipment is protected from overheating by means of temperature detectors, which automatically trigger a cooling cycle, which also caters to equipment or power failures. The first BIOTOX unit was installed in March 1993 at BPCO asphalt paper saturation plant in Montreal (Canada). Designed to treat a flow of 15 000 scfm of asphalt fumes with a organic compounds concentration of 1200 mg/m3, the system has completely eliminated the odors, and the reduction of total organic compounds was consistently over 94%. A second unit, with a capacity of 20 000 scfm, was installed at the same asphalt paper plant in January 1995. A higher organic compound concentration in the fumes at the inlet required the implementation of a bake-out procedure in order to eliminate any risks of tar accumulation. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

This paper reviews the design development and operating history of the Tampa facility. The following topics are discussed: initial odor panel testing performed at a similar sludge drying facility, design considerations necessary to accommodate the RTOs, VOC performance testing of the RTO's, and critical operations and maintenance considerations. At the Tampa facility, sewage sludge is dried in rotary dryers in which hot 1000-degree-F gases come in direct contact with the sludge, resulting in highly odorous offgases. Odor testing at a similar sludge drying facility confirmed that wet scrubbing systems would not adequately control the organic odors from a direct contact sludge dryer. At the Tampa facility, RTOs were used to treat the dryer offgas. Controlling the particulate loading of the dryer offgas was critical to the successful operation of the RTOs. The RTOs demonstrated 96%-97% destruction of VOCs and effectively controlled odors as evidenced by the absence of odor complaints. © 2004 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam.

In this study, the effectiveness of applying dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) to destroy and remove these two odor-causing compounds from gas streams via the generation of gas-phase radicals and high-energy electrons is experimentally evaluated with a bench-scale apparatus. Experimental results indicate that the removal efficiencies of both H<inf>2</inf>S and NH<inf>3</inf> with DBD plasmas depend on the gas composition, gas residence time, and applied voltage. Electronegative gases, such as O2 and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>(g</inf>), tend to increase the electron attachment and therefore decrease removal efficiencies. Simultaneous removal of H<inf>2</inf>S and NH<inf>3</inf> from gas streams is accomplished with DBD technology.

The results show that dispersed CuO<inf>x</inf> is formed up to a loading of about one theoretical layer. TPR indicates the formation of two types of dispersed species, which possibly are isolated and polymeric, respectively. XPS data show that the dispersed copper is Cu2+. The dispersed species have high catalytic activity for combustion. At higher copper oxide loading, bulk CuO is formed, contributing little to the activity. Comparison of three titania supports with differing surface area and pore size distribution shows that the most favorable is a support with a surface area of about 38 m2/g and mesopores in the range 100-800 A. The longevity of the catalysts was tested in the waste gas from a formaldehyde plant. Deactivation was observed after being on stream for 57 days, and the deactivation is due to sintering of both the support and the copper oxide.

The pressure was varied from 1.6-5 bar and the temperature from 180-220 °C for ethene oxidation and from 280-330 °C for propane oxidation. The maximum hydrocarbon concentration was ca. 3000 ppm or 0.3vol.%. The effect of the reaction products and the co-educt on the kinetics was investigated and it is shown that whereas water significantly retards the oxidation, the influence of CO<inf>2</inf> is negligible. Propane oxidation is inhibited by ethene. Such inhibition can only partly be explained by the additional water formed due to the combustion of ethene. The conversions in these experiments studied ranged between 70% and 90% for ethene and between 15% and 30% for propane, respectively. Four different rate expressions have been tested bearing in mind that the influence of water must be taken into account in any adequate description of the experimental data.

Compared to thermal oxidation units, these units are much smaller in size and weight and can be modularized for easy installation. These benefits, together with low oxides of nitrogen (NO,) emissions and less expensive metallurgy, make catalytic recuperative systems an attractive solution to VOC emission control. These systems are the most cost- effective for flows under 850 Nm 3/min over a wide renge of VOC concentrations. For larger flow, both catalytic recuperative and thermal regenerative sustems can compete on equal economic terma.

Adsorptive capacities and breakthrough characteristics for eight VOCs found in many hazardous landfill leachates and contaminated groundwater were compared for selection of the best adsorbent and optimum treatment conditions. Coconut shell‐based activated carbons exhibited higher VOC loading capacities than coal‐based carbons, fiber carbon, molecular sieve and zeolite. Steam and hot nitrogen were both effective for regeneration of the spent carbon. A small quantity of adsorbates left in the regenerated carbon did not result in immediate VOC breakthrough in the next cycle adsorption treatment. Catalytic oxidation was found to be an attractive alternative for VOC disposal. Using a new commercial catalyst developed for destruction of halogenated organic compounds, even stable VOCs such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene were completely destroyed at <350°C when oxidation was conducted at a space velocity of 17000/hr.

The operation of a conventional air-lift bioreactor at a waste-water flow rate of 0.24 l h-1 led to 33% of the DCE supplied to the reactor being lost to the exit gas stream.

This research was based on the concept held by some that natural chemicals are better as a part of industrial ecology. The authors have attempted to define the foam manufacturing suitability of natural chemicals, but have not defined or defended the policy implications of such choices. Natural chemicals are often less suitable than those refined from petroleum and may then need some environmental credit related to greater discharge to be viable substitutes. Modest decreases in density (relative to foams without any auxiliary blowing agent) were obtained with the addition of solid CO<inf>2</inf>but other physical properties were not measured. It is unclear whether the reduction in density is a result of the phase change of CO, from solid to liquid within the polyurethane cell matrix or simply a bubbling effect of C02 in solution causing voids within the final product. Although it was anticipated that the high boiling point of limonene, from citrus peeis, would negate effectiveness as an auxiliary blowing agent, there were analogous decreases in foam density. The observed effect might be rationalized by the significant vapor pressure of limonene at temperatures lower than the boiling point. The limonene may be sweptf rom the foam system coincident with the loss of in situ generated CO<inf>2</inf>isoprene, naturally emitted from deciduous vegetation as well as from the combustion of carbonaceous fuels, provides a useful, if not complete, range of foam densities and may then be a partial substitute for halogenated auxiliary blowing agents. Switching from methyiene chloride to isoprene as the auxiliary blowing agent of choice would immediately decrease organic emissions from polyurethane foam plants by 20 percent (molecular weight effect). Regulation as a VOC and the residual acrid odor may be potential drawbacks to commercial utilization of isoprene. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acetone; Carbon Dioxide; Dichloromethane; Isoprene; Limonene; Pinene; Polyurethan Foam; Acetone; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbon; Dichloromethane; Halogenated Hydrocarbon; Isoprene; Limonene; Organic Compound; Pinene; Polyurethan Foam; Chemical Waste; Chemistry; Conference Paper; Density; Pollution Control","acetone; carbon dioxide; chlorofluorocarbon; dichloromethane; halogenated hydrocarbon; isoprene; limonene; organic compound; pinene; polyurethan foam; chemical waste; chemistry; conference paper; density; pollution control","","acetone, 67-64-1; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; dichloromethane, 75-09-2; isoprene, 78-79-5; limonene, 138-86-3, 5989-27-5; pinene, 80-56-8; polyurethan foam, 9009-54-5","Water-blown and solid CO2-blown foams were prepared by MariaAmigo as an undergraduate research student.
